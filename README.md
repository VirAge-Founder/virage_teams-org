## VirAge Teams Organizational Documents

Welcome to VirAge Teams!  

We are the Digital Knowledge Workers Collective (Cooperative) founded by technologists and professionals working in the Digital Industry (creating the meta-verse of platforms, tools, technologies and products to advance human-to-human and human-to-machine interactions) with the single purpose:  to help ourselves and our colleagues escape the burden of "wage slavery" and realize our creative potential through collective and collaborative work in agile and highly efficient teams dedicated to each other, our clients, and the principles of Trust, Commitment, Fairness and Responsibility for products we create to make the world a better place. 

In this repository, you will find our foundational documents.  We are in the process of building a solid model for individuals and teams to participate in the Collective, as equal partners, and we are looking for input and feedback from all who share the idea that the Knowledge Workers have an opportunity to build a better free world, where the technology is not the means to further enslave and oppress, but to help us all flourish and succeed as individuals and professionals, exploring new models of workplace organization and having the true equal opportunities to partake in the results of our labor.
