   objectives. Officers’ scope is to facilitate developing the overall 
   Program as a strategic value stream for the Collective.  Officers

   1.1.13. Managers.

   operations and activities according the established Programs.  
   Managers are responsible for execution of concrete activities in 
   support of the Program.  Managers report to all Members on the tasks 
   completion.  
   
   1.1.14. Committees.  
   
   The Collective may elect to appoint several of its Members to a 
   committee to oversee, guide and regulate specific large-scale 
   activities which may be too difficult for a single Officer or 
   Manager to handle.  Members appointed or elected into the Committees 
   will have equal rights and responsibilities and they will coordinate 
   their votes on important decisions by the Committees.  The Committees 
   will provide accountability and reporting to the Members through

   Product-related Programs can be created on a voluntary funding basis, 
   so that only Members who want to support the Program can provide 
   allocation from their Capital Accounts.  The Collective expects that 
   Members working on the Product will provide allocations to the 
   Product in the established amounts.  

   1.1.16. Meetings and Locations. 
   
   The Collective is a company by Digital Workers for Digital Workers.  
   Collaboration is the core principle of creating and delivering value.  
   Digital Workers collaborate in Teams and, for large programs, 
   in a Team of Teams.  In traditional organizations, in-person 
   collaboration is always preferred.  The Collective also encourages 
   the in-person collaboration whenever possible.  Additionally, 
   he Collective promotes the notion of a “Digital Enterprise,” 
   in which not only the nature of work allows remotely collaboration, 
   but also the principles of Consensus and Transparency are fundamental 
   for managing the decision policies, accountability and commitment 
   to goals and objectives, collectively defined and agreed upon by all 
   Members.  The concept of a “Meeting” is extended to the digital 
   realm where the requirement of real-time simultaneous presence of all 
   Members is not necessary to the desired outcome of producing a 
   thoroughly discussed, informed, collaborated and accepted decision.  
   Moreover, every Member has the means to review and study all pertinent 
   documents, statements, comments, all pros and cons of every item on 
   the ballot, as well as to provide his/her own constructive feedback, 
   recommendations and revisions for everybody else to consider before 
   taking the final vote.  Managing organization this way relieves the 
   need to maintain an office or a permanent location for the company 
   for gathering and meetings.  

     1.1.16.1. Local Offices When Needed
     
	 The Collective may establish temporary or permanent locations for 
	 specific teams, if such locations provide for efficiency and 
	 productivity of Members’ teams working on specific program.
	 
	 1.1.16.2. Digital Records First.  
	 
	 Whether Members work remotely or operate from specific locations, 
	 all communications between the Members regarding statement, reviews, 
	 discussions, decisions are conducted through digital electronic 
	 medium with a full record of agendas, issues discussed, issues 
	 voted on, the voting results, and assignment of roles and 
	 responsibilities.  
	 
	 1.1.16.3. Records Preservation and Access Control. 
	 
	 Members shall determine the best electronic means to keep records 
	 and provide transparency and access for all Members of the 
	 Collective.  If any sensitive confidential information needs to be 
	 recorded, such information will be stored in a secure protected 
	 medium with limited access only by Members responsible for record 
	 keeping.  Any Member may request access to such information 
	 through a process that is established to record the name of the 
	 requester, the reason, and any other information, to ensure a 
	 Member’s responsibility to protect and secure company’s information. 
  	 
   1.1.17. Pronouns. 
   
   Pronouns like “he” or “she” or “he/she”, when used here, refer 
   equally to the feminine or masculine gender or to the gender that a 
   Member chooses to be associated with for the purpose of the Member’s 
   interest in the Collective, Member’s relations with other Members, 
   the clients of the Collective, partners, suppliers and any 3rd party 
   entities.  Members are welcomed to clearly indicate their 
   appropriate pronouns if they find it necessary at their discretion. 
   
   1.1.18.  Communications and Notices.  
   
   Members agree that Communications and Notices to Members, employees 
   and any associates of the Collective will be provided in electronic 
   form (email, text, digitally encrypted bits or any similar format).  
   Any physical document, hand-written or types, shall be digitized, 
   and such electronic copy will be officially accepted as an original.  
	
   1.1.19. Acknowledgment of Notices.  
   
   Members agree that all important electronic documents should state 
   “acknowledgment required”, and such acknowledgment must be returned 
   by the receiving Member for the document to be deemed delivered.  
   
   
   
1.2. THE OPERATING AGREEMENT

   1.2.1. Operating Agreement Definition. 
   
   The "Operating Agreement" (the "Agreement") is this document that 
   establishes the principles, terms and rules of how the Collective is 
   organized and operates. This Operating Agreement must be accepted 
   and agreed (in a written and/or secure electronic form) by any 
   person or entity that wants to become a Member of the Collective.
   
   1.2.2. Initial Version. 
   
   he initial version of the Operating Agreement will be created by the 
   Founding Member(s) and will be in effect through the startup and 
   bootstrap period. The Operating Agreement is a versioned document, 
   with only one (latest) version being current and binding for any 
   matters concerning the Collective. 
   
   1.2.3. The Operating Agreement Revisions. 
   
   The Operating Agreement must be revised and unanimously voted by 
   all Members after completion of the bootstrap period and every two 
   (2) years of operations hereinafter.  Any Member can request putting

   receive consent of at least 75% of Members to start the review. 
   The unanimous consent is required to approve the new Operating 
   Agreement. Modifications are allowed to the entire document or to 
   individual sections. 
   
   1.2.4. Signing the Agreement.  
   
   Every Member must sign the current active version of the Agreement 
   at the time of joining the Collective or upon the adoption of the 
   new version. The Collective shall make the Agreement (the current 
   and all previous versions) available to every Member.



1.3. THE LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY AS A  WORKER COOPERATIVE
   
   1.3.1. Designation. 
   
   The Collective designates itself as a “Worker Cooperative”.  
   A Worker Cooperative operates on the fair and democratic principle 
   of “One Member – One Vote” where all fundamental decisions are made 
   by a general vote of Members, and the operational concrete day-to-day 
   decisions are made by the elected and appointed Officers, Managers, 
   and the Committees with the limited delegated powers for specific 
   tasks related to execution. The words “Collective” and “Cooperative”
   are interchangeable for the purpose of this Agreement, and 
   “Collective” will be the primary term used hereinafter. 
   
   1.3.2. Composition. 
   
   The 51% of the Collective’s workers must be Worker-Members. 
   The Collective will not accept new Member-Candidates or hire 
   employees, if the number of Members in the total ratio of workers is
   below the stated percentage.
   
   1.3.3. Federated Cooperative. 
   
   The Collective is a Federated Cooperative with a hybrid membership 
   model: individual members (persons) and other cooperatives 
   associated by line of business or by location can be Members (or 
   Member-Candidates) of this Collective.  When an entity is a 
   federated member of the Collective, the entity has only one vote in 
   the Collective’s decisions, regardless the number of members or 
   partners in the federated member. 
   
   1.3.4. Worker Cooperative Objective. 
   
   The objective of this Collective is to serve the the interest of 
   its Members by creating and developing opportunities for economic, 
   professional, educational and social advancement through fair and 
   gainful engagement in the Collective’s business activities, as 
   responsible business owners and business operators, acting 
   collectively in small and large teams with equal and democratic 
   rights to make decisions about how this Collective operates, 
   its strategy, its programs, its business objectives and methods 
   of operation.
   
   1.3.5. Income. 
   
   Unlike a traditional corporation, the Collective does not aim to 
   increase its own profits as the way to increase the shareholders’ 
   value. Working Members of the Collective are the owners, and the 
   value of their share of business depends on their direct 
   contribution to the Collective.  More income they generate through 
   the Collective, more they will receive back through Patronage 
   Distributions, after the Collective covers costs of sustaining and 
   growing the business. The Collective is to provide continuous source 
   of income and opportunities to increase such income to its Members.  
   Income level of each individual Member of the Collective will 
   depend on:
   
     1.3.5.1. Member’s Fair Market Value of skills, experience and 
     competencies that he/she applies in his/her work at the Collective;
   
     1.3.5.2. Member’s level of participation in the Collective’s 
     business, where equal opportunities shall be provided to all to 
     achieve their individual objectives. 



1.4. THE LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY AS A DECENTRALIZED AUTONOMOUS 
COLLECTIVE

   1.4.1. Teams.  
   
   The Collective is a platform for Digital Workers to create 
   long-lasting teams and even more complex teams of teams when working 
   on large scale Value Streams.  Teams have autonomy and power to 
   decide the matters of their existence and operations, as long as 
   they are working under the general guidelines of this Agreement. 
   
   1.4.2. Teams and Members.
   
   Members organize into Teams on a voluntary basis.  The guiding 
   principles for organizing into Teams are about augmenting and 
   strengthening individual competencies into cross-functional 
   capabilities to deliver a Minimal Valuable Product (MVP) in any 
   Program. The Collective at large, through jointly-achieved decisions 
   and consensus, may recommend specific candidates to any Team, such 
   that the augmented Teams gain efficiency, necessary competency, 
   leadership or any other aspect of a successful program execution.  
   
   1.4.3. Teams and Programs.
   
   Teams are usually formed to execute specific programs, either 
   internal or external.   If individual Members possess competencies 
   and skills (in various areas, either technical, or business, or 
   artistic) necessary to perform a task or create a single feature 
   (an element of a product, but not a full product by itself), a Team 
   exemplifies a Capability that is required to execute any Program 
   that results in creating a Product (or Minimal Viable Product, that 
   is a complete application with end-to-end functionality meeting 
   certain requirements and usable by the intended customer base).  
   Teams are formed to support the established and approved Programs, 
   voted in by all Members.  Conversely, a few Members can form a Team 
   and propose a new Program for which they form a Capability.  
   The proposed Program must be approved by all Members in the 
   Collective if the Program requires budget allocation from the 
   Collective’s general Unallocated Capital Account or from the 
   Reserve Fund.  If a Program is created by Members who want to fund 
   it from the Capital Accounts only of the Members participating in 
   the Program, the general Collective’s approval is not required, 
   but the Program and the Team must be registered in the list of all 
   Collective’s teams and programs.  The Collective shall consider 
   federating such Teams working on specific programs into their own 
   federated collectives to simplify management operations.  This 
   approach supports the spirit of decentralization and self-management.
   
   
   
1.5. GOVERNANCE
   
   1.5.1. Supremacy of the US and California Laws.

   Members. 



1.6. DEFINITIONS

   
   1.6.1. Terms and Definitions.  
   
   The following terms and definitions are established for the purpose 
   of this Agreement.
   
   Candidate:
   
     “Candidate” means a worker who is being considered for membership 
     in a worker cooperative (the Collective), as defined in the 
     Agreement.  Candidate is a person who has completed all 
     requirements for the membership, as per this Agreement, but has 
     not received the approval vote from the Members yet.  Candidate 
     probation period is 3 months, but it can be shortened by the 
     Members’ decision to accept the Candidate.  If Members do not 
     approve the Candidate, the Capital Account contribution will be 
     returned to the Candidate, and the annual membership fees will be 
     reimbursed in the amount prorated for the period when the worker 
     was a Candidate with the Collective.  During the probation period, 
     the Candidate can earn income for which he/she will be paid the 
     Discounted Fair Market Value (DFMV), as defined in this Agreement.  
     The earned Surplus will be accounted on the Candidate’s Capital 
     Account and it will be eligible for distribution to the Candidate 
     upon his/her acceptance as a Member.  If the Candidate is rejected, 
     the earned Surplus will remain with the Collective.  A Candidate 
     cannot work on a non-billable internal program that does not 
     generate income from an external client, unless such internal 
     program has an allocated budget from which a wage salary can be 
     paid as per the Candidate’s established DFMV and the Candidate 
     will be considered an independent contractor with all tax 
     implications thereof.    
     
   Cooperative Developer:
   
     Cooperative Developer or Non-Profit Organizations are allowed to 
     invest in and support the development of cooperative enterprises. 
     Innovative models for launching new businesses are allowed for 
     flexibility, while maintaining and ensuring worker-owner control.  
     The Collective allows one or more Cooperative Developers to become 
     “Not Natural Person” Member, regardless of the internal 
     organization of such entity (a cooperative, collective, a limited 
     liability company, a corporation or individual proprietorship).  
     
   Community-Investor:

      “Community investor” means a person who is not a Worker-Member 
      and who holds a share or other proprietary interest in a worker 
      cooperative.  No outside investors are required for this 
      Collective. 

      If Community-Investors are invited to this Collective, they will 
      have no voting rights.

      The only right that the Community-Investors will be given in this 
      Collective is the limited approval rights over decisions that may 
      affect their investment, such as approval over a decision to sell 
      off the assets of the cooperative or merge it with another 
      cooperative.  If the Members of this Collective decide to invite 
      Community-Investors, the Collective shall establish specific 
      rules regulating their relationships and interest in the 
      Collective.  “No voting rights” provision cannot be overwritten 
      or changed, unless the Members unanimously change this Agreement 
      to allow such change.  
   
   Consulting: 
      
      “Consulting” means any Revenue generation work for Clients, when 
      services are rendered on custom solution development engagements 
      (software, product development, program management, etc.). 
   
   Federated Cooperative: 

      A Federated Cooperative is a Cooperative company (that can be 
      structured as a Limited Liability Company) with a membership 
      accepting a “Not Natural Person Member.”  This allows creating a 
      federated structure for a Cooperative of many Cooperatives, 
      underlining the decentralized and independent nature of the 
      Virtual Agile Teams concept.  Cooperatives that are formed and 
      participate in this “Federated Cooperative” Collective may chose 
      to create their own rules, procedures and processes, as long as 
      such governance documents do not contradict this Agreement and 
      other Collective’s rules and procedures. 
      
    Digital Identity (DI), Digital Wallet (DW), Digital Storage (DS): 

      The Collective sets the goal to create infrastructure for Members 
      to collaborate through the network of Digital Identities (DI) 
      securely representing them in any and all transactions, like 
      voting, time keeping, contract signing, receiving or sending 
      payments, distributions, allocating funds and all others, as per 
      this Agreement.  In order to implement and apply Digital Identity, 
      the Collective shall use the principles of Self-Soverign Identity 
      (SSI) and tools, like Digital Wallets (DW) and Digital Agents 
      (DA, device local and Cloud-based), which are secure, 
      cryptography-based and user-centric systems.  DI (through SSI, 
      DW and DA) enables a Member to be in full control of his/her 
      identity, deciding which attributes of it to share with other 
      Members or the external parties, indisputably verify Member’s 
      identity in all voting and other decision-making activities, 
      digitally sign any documents and communications, and allow secure 
      access  to any private secure information stored for the Member 
      in Digital Storage (DS). Such implementation based on the SSI 
      standards, will allow a secure and reliable solution with maximum 
      interoperability across SSI providers.  DW and DS are foundations 
      of the decentralized nature of the Collective, where the control 
      of the spend, the decisions to allocate resources, 
      the record-keeping, verifications of votes and consensus are 
      literally in the hands of the Members and not the 3rd party or 
      a centralized entity.  
      
    Discounted Fair Market Value (DFMV), the Surplus: 
      
      "Fair Market Value" is the total compensation in dollars for 1 hour 
      of work that a Member can earn working in his/her profession, in 
      his/her specialty, with his/her skills and level of expertise on 
      the open market, if worked as an independent contractor.  The FMV 
      is different from the average industry salary, if a Member is 
      hired directly by an employer, since the total hourly wage in
      dollars can be lower to allow for the cost of benefits, like 
      health insurance, educational and other costs, covered by 
      employers to the total compensation package.  
       
      The Collective sets the FMV as a sum of two elements:
      
      - The Discounted Fair Market Value (DFMV)
      - The Surplus
      
      The DFMV is the amount that a Member earned in 1 hour of his/her 
      work on an income generation engagement for an external client 
      and that is eligible for immediate distribution to the Member on 
      a regular basis (weekly, bi-weekly or upon payment from the client).  
      
      The Surplus is the amount that a Member earned in 1 hour of his/her 
      work on an income generation engagement for an external client, 
      that is retained by the Collective to cover costs, expenses and 
      to fund Programs of the Collective.  The Surplus is a Member’s 
      contribution to the Collective through his/her work.  The Surplus 
      is eligible for distribution to Members (in the form of the 
      Patronage Distributions) upon the decision of all Members to be 
      made annually on the amount of the Surplus accumulated in the 
      fiscal year.  
      
      The Collective shall set the proportion of the DFMV and the Surplus 
      annually by 75% vote.  Unless such decision is make, the Surplus 
      is set at 40% of FMV for every Member.   
   
   Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT): 
     
     “Distributed Ledger Technology” (DLT) is the infrastructure 
     backbone of a digital decentralized enterprise, such as the 
     Collective, as it provides the secure, distributed (no single point 
     of failure) and near real-time database for recording events and 
     transactions in the enterprise that are accessible and verifiable 
     by all involved parties.  Various implementations of DLT exist, and 
     the Collective seeks to deploy and integrate with the DLT vendors 
     that provide the best solutions for security, usability, cost and 
     ability to extend and apply to new use cases that the Collective 
     will develop.
   
   Member: 
   
     “Member,” also defined as “Worker-Member” or “Worker-Owner,” means 
     any natural person or a group of natural people, who chose to act 
     as a single entity for the purpose of this Agreement, and who 
     fulfills the following conditions: 
     
       a) agrees to all provisions of this Agreement
       b) has accepted this Agreement by attaching his/her signature
       c) has ontributed the specified amount of funds to the Capital 
       Account
       d) has paid the annual membership fees
       e) has been unanimously voted in by all active current Members in 
       good standing
     
     A Member who has met all above conditions is given One (1) Vote on 
     all decisions of this Collective.
     
     A Member is “Active”, “Current”, “In Good Standing” when all the 
     above provisions are fulfilled, and the Member has not resigned or 
     terminated his membership in the Collective.  An active, current 
     and in-good-standing Member has the right to One (1) Vote on any 
     matter and decision in the Collective.
     
     A Member is a “Non-Voting Member” when the person or entity, who 
     previously was an active current Member in good standing failed 
     to meet the membership conditions for the new fiscal year.  
     A Non-Voting Member can continue working at the Collective and 
     receive patronage distribution equal to his/her established DFMV, 
     but not the distribution from the Surplus part of his/her income.  
     If a Member is a Non-Voting Member for over 12 months, the Members 
     can terminate his/her membership in the Collective by a majority 
     vote.  Such vote will constitute a “Volunteer Termination” by 
     a Member, making him/her eligible for the benefits under such 
     ermination, as per this Agreement. 
     
     A Member is a “Founding Member,” if he/she is natural person who 
     joined the Collective prior to receipt of any income generated 
     from the operations of the Collective, headed an activity, 
     a program, or had a set of responsibilities to bootstrap the 
     Collective or any of its units, divisions, departments or lines of 
     business, contributed to establishing day to day operations of such 
     units and divisions.  It is expected that there will be no more 
     than 15-20 Founding Members.  If the Collective growth demands 
     that more than 15-20 people are engaged in the above stated 
     activities, all Members can appoint, by the majority vote, 
     additional Founding Members, awarding them for their continuous 
     contribution to the Collective, with all benefits of the Founding 
     Members given to them.
   
   Member who is “Not a Natural Person”:
   
     A “Not Natural Person Member” is a member of the Collective which 
     is an entity, a team or a group of natural people (who at the time 
     of their such organization are already Members of this Collective) 
     dedicating themselves to a specific purpose or to conduct a 
     business activity, and for that purpose, have chosen to set 
     internal rules and procedures for their own group but still 
     remaining a part of the Collective under this Agreement.  Such Not 
     Natural Person Member will receive One Vote on the matters of this 
     Federated Cooperative business, but the Members who chose to be 
     part of the Not Natural Person Member will suspend their right to 
     vote on the Federated Cooperative matters and will only be allowed 
     to vote on the issues of their own entity.  
     
     The Collective will handle the Surplus and the losses to the 
     Capital Accounts of all natural people Members who form such entity, 
     team or group (defined as a Not Natural Person Member) separately 
     from other Members in the Federated Cooperative.  
     
     Formation of a “Not Natural Person” Member must be recorded in the 
     Collective’s list of all Members with the specific updates to the 
     organizing members reallocating their Voting Rights only to the
     matter of the new entity.  
   
   Patron:
   
     The Agreement defines the patrons of a worker cooperative as 
     Worker-Members or Worker-Owners (herein referred to as “Members”) 
     who market, promote and deliver their products and services to 
     clients through the Collective, earn income and are entitled to 
     receive DFMV and part of the Surplus paid out through the patronage 
     distribution, with their share of the Surplus to be measured by 
     the work performed by them against all other Members in the 
     Collective.
   
   Patronage Distribution:
   
     “Patronage Distributions” are net earnings, after the Collective’s 
     costs and expenses, for a period of time when earned, and paid to 
     a Member as his/her share in the business.  Patronage Distributions 
     shall be apportioned among the Members in accordance with the ratio 
     of each Member’s patronage during the period to the total patronage 
     by all members during the same period.
   
     The Collective must make patronage distributions only to the 
     Worker-Member class.
   
     Patronage Distributions are paid in the US Dollars, but the ratio 
     calculation is done in “Pie Slices,” as stated in this Agreement.  
   
   Patronage Measurement:
   
     Patronage is measured by the value that a Member brings to the 
     Collective.   Patronage Measurement is necessary for calculating 
     Patronage Distributions.  Patronage measurement is done in abstract 
     units, called “Pie Slices,” as described in the Slicing Pie 
     Principle of this Agreement. 
   
   Profit:
   
     Profit is the Net Revenue earned by the Collective (after the 
     Collective’s cost and expenses) that is attributable to work done 
     by Non-Members (non-member labor). 
     
     The Collective allocates 100% of the Profit (the net revenue that 
     was attributable to non-member labor) the Collective’s Unallocated 
     Capital Account as retained earnings. Retained earnings are the 
     earnings that the Collective does not pay out.  The Collective will 
     pay tax on the retained Profits and all related employment taxes 
     or non-member employees. 
   
   Surplus:
   
     Each Member working at the Collective will be generating income 
     when working on a Program funded by an external client.  This 
     income has two parts: 
     
       a) the Discounted Fair Market Value (DFMV) that a Member and 
       the Collective established for the Member based on the skills, 
       experience and the market rates for such skills, and
       
       b) the Surplus that the Collective adds on top of a Member’s DFMV 
       to generate profit for the Member and cover the Collective’s 
       operational costs
       
     Earned DFMV amounts are calculated on a regular basis (weekly, 
     bi-weekly, or upon payment from client) and are paid to Members 
     within 30 days after payment by client.
     
     The Surplus is allocated to the Member’s Capital Account.  A part 
     of the Surplus (after the Collective’s costs, expenses and Programs’ 
     budget allocation) can be eligible for Patronage Distribution, 
     based on the Collective’s decision (Members vote) as per this 
     Agreement.  
   
   The Slicing Pie Principle – Dynamic Equity Allocation:
   
     “The Slicing Pie” principle and the dynamic equity allocation model 
     is described in Mike Moyer’s books “Slicing Pie, Funding Your 
     Company Without Funds, Version 2.3” and “Slicing Pie Handbook, 
     Perfect Equity Splits for Startups.”   The core idea of the Slicing 
     Pie principle is to establish a fair and universal unit of measure 
     for a Member’s contribution to a startup with no initial funds or 
     investments.  This model applies to the Collective as well.  
     Moreover, the model can be applied on any “at-risk” investment of 
     time and effort, when the results are uncertain to establish the 
     upfront compensation structure or allocation of the future 
     (uncertain) results.  
     
     All Members have different level of skills and experience.  
     Members can work different amount of hours.  Member’s contributions 
     differ significantly on any effort to create a value for the 
     Collective, such as new business opportunities, new products, 
     acquiring new clients, developing products, or maintaining systems.  
     In traditional, non-digital and low-skills cooperative, patronage 
     value is usually established on the number of hours each Member 
     worked, since the wages are relatively low and vary insignificantly 
     among all members.  In a digital, knowledge-based economy, all 
     Members have advanced, highly valued skills, and their level or 
     experience and qualifications can differ greatly from each other.  
     Measuring the patronage based just on hours alone will not 
     accurately reflect Members’ contributions.  Thus, the Discounted 
     Fair Market Value of each Member is used and multiplied by number 
     of hours worked.  The resulting value is not a dollar amount, 
     but an abstract unit of measure for everyone’s contribution.  
     Mike Moyer called this process: “Baking the Pie.”  Each Member 
     provides “ingredients” – or his/her contribution of skills and 
     experience measured over time contributed – until the pie is baked, 
     in other words, when the results are received.  At this point, 
     when the tangible results are available (in the form of the Net 
     Income), the “Pie” can be divided between the contributing Members 
     into “Slices,” which are the proportion of a Member’s contributions 
     against all other Members’ contributions.  The general formula for 
     the “Pie Slices” calculations is:
       
       1 Pie Slice = DFMV in US Dollars x Total Hours Worked 
     
     A more complex formula can add a special coefficient (for risk or 
     other factors), and it will be:
     
       1 Pie Slice = DFMV in US Dollars x Total Hours Worked x Coefficient 
     
     The Collective will establish if the Coefficient applies on all or 
     only special Programs.  The Coefficient default value is set to: 
     1 (one).
     
     Naturally, Members with higher and more advanced skills, who have 
     a higher DFMV, will have more “Slices” for work performed during 
     the same hours than Members with lower skills, and lower DFMV 
     respectively.  On the other hand, Members with lower DFMV, who 
     worked longer hours, can deliver higher value to the Company and be 
     entitled to more earned “Slices” through this algorithm.  This is a 
     dynamic equity allocation model, and slices are constantly 
     accumulated and compared between all Members.  When a pay-out is 
     voted by Members, it is very simple to calculate each Member’s 
     share in the “Pie” as it is the proportion of the Member’s amount 
     of “Slices” to the entire “Pie”.   
     
     The cumulative Surplus amount earned by all Members is the “Pie”, 
     although the individual storage for the Member’s earned Surplus is 
     in the Member’s Capital Account.  
     
     It is important to understand that in a Digital Enterprise, like 
     the Collective, the concepts of Accounts (and their value), earnings, 
     contributions, costs, allocations, and other, are “Logical” concepts, 
     as the physical storage and implementation for systems that calculate 
     and persist the data can be distributed collaborating applications, 
     which produce a dynamically calculated result, every time a query, 
     like “what is the balance of my Capital Account?” or “what is the 
     amount of the Surplus that I am entitled to receive, if the Patronage 
     Distribution is done today?” 
     
   Voting Power:
     
     Voting Power means the power given to every active current Member 
     in good standing to vote on issues of the Collective that are put 
     on the ballot by any Member or scheduled for a vote according to 
     this Agreement.  Voting Power of all Members is equal, regardless 
     the amount held on their Capital Accounts, the number of “Pie Slices” 
     allocated to the Members for their work, the job title, skills, 
     experience.  Equal Voting Power does not mean, nor does it imply 
     equal proprietary rights.  Proprietary rights are the rights to 
     receive income from the Surplus.  Proprietary rights are apportioned 
     based on the speed of accumulation of “Pie Slices”, as stated in 
     this Agreement, which is determined by a Member’s DFMV and the 
     amount of hours worked.  
     
   Worker:
     
     “Worker” means a natural person contributing labor or services to 
     a worker cooperative.  Worker does not have to be a Member, as per 
     the definition in this Agreement.   The Collective will prefer to 
     convert all Workers into Worker-Members, otherwise they will be 
     treated as employees with all subsequent tax implications, unless 
     they perform a temporary limited work and will be treated as 
     independent contractors.  Members have an advantage over the Workers 
     who are independent contractors or employees, because Members are 
     entitled to the share of the Surplus from their revenue, whereas 
     other classes of workers are not (Profits from Non-Members’ 
     earnings remain with the Collective).  
     
   Worker Cooperative or Employment Cooperatives:
     
     “Worker cooperative” or “employment cooperative” means a company 
     formed under this Agreement that includes a class of Worker-Members 
     who are natural persons whose patronage consists of labor contributed 
     to or other work performed for the company. 
     
     Election to be organized 
     as a worker cooperative or an employment cooperative does not create 
     a presumption that workers are employees of the company for any 
     purposes. At least 51 percent of the workers shall be Worker-Members, 
     excluding candidates.  This Collective may hire workers (employees) 
     who are not Members and who will be considered employees of the 
     Collective with all related payroll, worker’s compensation, overtime 
     and tax implications.  
     
     Worker Cooperative can allow a membership from “Not a Natural Person” 
     Member, as stated in this Agreement.  



SECTION 2. CORE CONCEPTS

2.1. GENERAL PROVISIONS

   2.1.1. Approval and Voting.
    
   Every Member of the Collective must make a personal decision to 
   approve or deny any matter pertinent to the subject matter of this 
   Agreement, beginning with the decision to agree and accept this 
   Agreement.  Every such decision is a Vote, recorded and stored in 
   perpetuity for the life of this Collective.  Typically, the outcome 
   of a Vote is binary:  In Favor (“Yes” / “Accept” / “Approve”) or 
   Against (“No” / “Reject” / “Do Not Approve”).  The Collective shall 
   stipulate non-binary outcomes for the vote, when more options are 
   necessary to determine the Members’ decision.
   
   2.1.2. This Agreement is Unanimous. 
   
   Since every person, who applies for the Membership in the Collective, 
   must approve this Agreement by signing his/her name or providing 
   electronic proof of acceptance, it is deemed that this Agreement is 
   unanimously voted for by all Members.  
   
   2.1.3. Proof of Voting.  
   
   All matters of business and operations of this Collective, as 
   described in this Agreement, must be decided by each Member’s vote 
   in favor or against the proposed decision, statement, action, or any 
   other item proposed for voting.  This Collective does not allow 
   anonymous voting and all votes are recorded by name, time and any 
   additional attributes that shall be set forth by the Collective to 
   record the outcome of the vote in the irrefutable and verifiable 
   manner.  
   
     2.1.3.1.  Cryptography Tools. 
   
     The Collective will develop an electronic crypto-based system to 
     record all votes that will provide proof of vote, non-repudiation, 
     permanent and secure storage of ballots and results.
   
   2.1.4. Amendments. 
   
   Amendments to this Agreement may be proposed by any Member. A proposed 
   amendment will be adopted and become effective as an amendment only 
   upon the approval of all of the Members through a unanimous vote.
   
   2.1.5. Entire Agreement; Modification.
    
   This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding and agreement 
   between the Members with respect to the subject matter of this 
   Agreement. No agreements, understandings, restrictions, 
   representations, or warranties exist between or among the Members 
   other than those in this Agreement or referred to or provided for in 
   this Agreement. No modification or amendment of any provision of this 
   Agreement will be binding on any Member unless in writing and signed 
   by all the Members or recorded in digital format through the approved 
   method of digital captures, voting and storage. 
   
   2.1.6. Conflict Resolution. 
   
   The parties to this Agreement agree that the best way to resolve 
   conflicts is to understand that conflicts are unavoidable and natural 
   to any collaboration of people and entities with multiple views, 
   positions and values based on personal skills, experience and 
   economic interests.  Conflict Resolution begins with open and 
   transparent review and discussion of all issues and items that may 
   result in a conflict.  Interpretation of terms, definitions, clauses 
   of this Agreement and/or other rules, policies and procedures, as 
   well as establishing undisputed facts shall be clear and transparent 
   to all parties.  The Collective shall require three (3) rounds of 
   mediation of any conflict to be conducted by the conflicting Members 
   with the participation of at lest 3 other Members, not part of the 
   conflict.  If the three internal mediation fail to resolve the 
   conflict, the general Members’ meeting (physical in-person on location 
   or virtual remote) can be called.  The Member whose position is denied 
   by the Members, can seek remedies outside the Collective, including 
   and up to a civil litigation, however the Collective, in case of the 
   Collective’s judgment against the Member, shall defend the position 
   collectively voted by the Members and may allocate the necessary funds 
   for legal defense and other litigation related costs.  
   
   2.1.7. Attorney Fees. 
   
   In the event of any suit or action to enforce or interpret any 
   provision of this Agreement (or derivative documents based on this 
   Agreement), the prevailing party is entitled to recover, in addition 
   to other costs, reasonable attorney fees in connection with the suit, 
   action, or arbitration, and in any appeals. The determination of who 
   is the prevailing party and the amount of reasonable attorney fees to 
   be paid to the prevailing party will be decided by the court or courts, 
   including any appellate courts, in which the matter is tried, heard, 
   or decided.
   
   2.1.8. Further Effect. 
   
   The parties agree to execute other derivative documents reasonably 
   necessary to further effect and evidence the terms of this Agreement, 
   as long as the terms and provisions of the other documents are fully 
   consistent with the terms of this Agreement.
   
   2.1.9. Severability. 
   
   If any term or provision of this Agreement is held to be void or 
   unenforceable, that term or provision will be severed from this 
   Agreement, the balance of the Agreement will survive, and the balance 
   of this Agreement will be reasonably construed to carry out the intent 
   of the parties as evidenced by the terms of this Agreement.
   
   2.1.10. Captions. 
   
   The captions used in this Agreement are for the convenience of the 
   parties only and will not be interpreted to enlarge, contract, or 
   alter the terms and provisions of this Agreement.
   
   2.1.11. Notices. 
   
   All notices required to be given by this Agreement will be made 
   through the Member approved Digital Media, or in writing, and will 
   be effective when actually delivered or, if mailed, when deposited 
   as certified mail, postage prepaid, directed to the addresses, 
   provided by each Member, or to such other address as a Member may 
   specify by notice given in conformance with these provisions to the 
   other Members.
   
   
   

2.2. SELF-SUFFICIENCY 


   2.2.1. Commitment to Self-Sufficiency.  
   
   The Collective shall make the best effort to operate self-sufficiently 
   based on the contributions of its Members and actual work effort put 
   into every Collective’s program or activity.  The Collective shall 
   avoid outside investment, except in cases approved and voted in by all 
   Members when such investment does not create any property rights for 
   the outside investors, who may only be allowed the dividends 
   distributions on their investment, and such distributions must be 
   approved by the Members. 
   
   2.2.2. Lean-Agile Hypothesis Validation and Scaling. 
   
   The Collective operates on the notion of Scaling, which in the context 
   of this Agreement means that creation of Digital Knowledge-based 
   products and services does not require traditional high cost Capital, 
   such as land, machinery, equipment or any other element that requires 
   significant up-front capital investment.  All Collective’s activities 
   are hypothesis-based Lean-Agile activities that must prove their need 
   and significance for the profitability of the Collective. Every 
   expense and cost of the Collective must be justified to achieve the 
   stated objective voted in by the Members, and defined as a Program 
   for execution.  Every implementation of the Program must start with 
   the scaled-down implementation to prove the feasibility and 
   correctness of the decision, and is called the Minimum Valuable 
   Product (MVP).
   
   2.2.3. Horizon Budgeting for Programs. 
   
   The Members must vote on allocation of resources for each Program and 
   its MVP, if applicable, or the set goals to achieve.  The Collective 
   shall use the “horizon budgeting” approach for the Programs, 
   allocating enough resources to achieve the immediate goals, but 
   provide the opportunities to extend the Programs, should they prove 
   value and usability to the organization.  The Programs are implemented 
   in Increments (Program Increments – PI), and the first two PI’s should 
   be planned as specifically as possible, with the subsequent PI’s coming 
   into focus, as the goals are being achieved and new requirements become 
   more defined.  The Collective shall conduct retrospectives on the 
   results achieved at the end of each PI phase.  The Collective shall 
   make decisions whether to pivot or persevere on the Program execution.
   
   2.2.4. Funding Programs. 
   
   The Collective’s Self-Sufficiency is supported by the Members’ Capital 
   Accounts and the Collective’s own “Unallocated Capital Account” 
   defined in this Agreement.  These Capital Accounts are the primary 
   source of funding all Programs at the Collective.
   
   2.2.5. Funding Programs from External Sources. 
   
   If the Collective does not have resources for a desired Program to 
   create a product (or MVP), the Collective can vote to accept and 
   solicit external capital (non-Members’ capital), and specific rules 
   shall be established to regulate such investment.  The Collective 
   shall never accept the condition of the external investor’s voting 
   rights and any participation in the Program/MVP other than the roles 
   defined as: “Consulted” and “Informed,” as per the standard “RACI” 
   chart definitions.
   
   
   
2.3. INCOME AND REVENUES

   2.3.1. For-Profit Enterprise.  
   
   The Collective is a For-Profit business enterprise aimed at maximizing 
   income and revenue to the Worker Member-Owners through legal activities 
   permitted by the US and the State of California laws.  The Collective’s 
   income and revenues come from Services and Products that the Collective 
   creates and sells to clients as custom solutions or market segment 
   offerings. 
   
   2.3.2. Income and Revenue from Services. 
   
   The Collective shall, through its Members, provide services in the 
   knowledge domains of the so called “Digital Economy”, including but 
   not limited to, any industry that transforms itself to be driven by 
   data, operated by processes and methods implemented in software and 
   controlled by fully automated or hybrid workflows of machine-human 
   interactions.  Members’ knowledge and expertise on the subject matter 
   is the main Capital necessary to create value and provide such 
   services, such as: software development through software architecture, 
   design, code development, code deployment, computing infrastructure 
   development (both physical and code), and the related concepts.  
   Such Services are requested, defined for implementation, initially 
   estimated and funded by external clients, referred as “Clients.”
   
     2.3.2.1. Managed Investment Contracts (MIC).  
     
     Client can request Services for developing a concrete unique product.  
     The Collective shall charge the Client for the use of the Collective 
     Members’ Knowledge Capital.  The Collective shall engage with Clients 
     through the Managed Investment Contract method.  The Collective shall 
     not “sell the bodies” or individual Member’s time, but shall sell 
     the Capabilities that a Team or multiple Teams (aggregated as Agile 
     Release Trains, in SAFe methodology) can deliver to Clients.  Such 
     Capabilities will define the rate of value creation.   Clients pay 
     for the this rate in a predictable and managed way:  Teams deliver 
     the agreed upon value every Program Increment.  Just like purchasing 
     a car means to buy “the entire thing,” not just separate wheels, 
     engine, or the body, the Managed Investment Contract allows Clients 
     to utilize the entire capability of the Team.  Aggregating individual 
     competencies of Members in Teams that deliver Capabilities will allow 
     to charge a premium rate that is greater than the sum of individual 
     Member’s FMVs.  Unlike the Time and Materials model common in many 
     engagement by to the top industry consulting companies (the so called 
     “the Big 5 (or 6, or 10),” MIC model is all about optimizing the lead 
     time and eliminating waste in the process, as the Team is focused on 
     building the solution based on the user stories, enablers and 
     features provided as inputs at the beginning of every Program 
     Increment.  The Collective, through the Teams assigned to Clients 
     and/or Committees created to manage client engagement, will 
     establish MIC for each engagement.  Client payments on MIC will 
     constitute the Income and Revenue from Services.
   
     2.3.2.2. Value of MIC.  
     
     The Value of the Managed Investment Contracts is calculated as the 
     sum of all FMVs of the Members working on the Client engagement plus 
     additional Surplus applied to the entire Team (in addition to the 
     Surplus calculated in the FMV).   This premium price for MIC will 
     allow the Collective to provide necessary agility and flexibility 
     to deliver the agreed value by allocating additional resources (if 
     needed and transparent to the client) to maintain the quality, 
     velocity and cadence of value release.
     
   2.3.3. Income and Revenue from Products.  
   
   The Collective can, through its Members, develop, market, solicit and 
   sell Digital Products, both purely software or Cyber Physical  systems 
   (combination of code and hardware, or machines).  Products are 
   designed for certain categories of users/customers and market segments.  
   As such, they will be sold as licenses to many Clients to use and 
   operate the Products, and the revenue from these license sales will 
   be the Income and Revenue from Products.  There could be a significant 
   difference in time when the income from Services is received in 
   comparison to when the income from Products is received, the former 
   being potentially much shorted, as value delivery is scheduled for 
   every Program Increment completed on regular cadence.  Product delivery 
   may take longer and hence the income from Products may be delayed.  
   The Collective allows Members working on a specific Product to form 
   a separate entity, as Sub-Collective where they will establish methods 
   to account for contributions, risk and profit sharing from the 
   Product’s revenues.  Product development has a risk factor, so 
   Members should be able to be compensated for this risk differently 
   than Members who have less or no risk at all in receiving income w
   orking on Managed Investment Contract engagements.  Members working 
   on Products may receive a coefficient in calculating their “Pie Slices” 
   contribution.  
   
   2.3.4. Income and Revenue generation Work.  
   
   When Members work on Services or Products (that eventually will be 
   sold and generate income), they will establish the revenue stream to 
   themselves and the Collective.  Members working on Services will be 
   compensated for their work upon payments from Clients.  Such Members 
   will receive their Discounted Fair Market Value (DFMV) immediately 
   upon such payments.  Members working on Products will be compensated 
   from the income from selling Products.  Such Members will receive 
   their DFMV payments when income is received.  Both categories of 
   Members will receive their part of the Surplus (calculated and 
   retained by the Collective from the sale of Services and the Products) 
   at the time when the Collective, through the all Members’ vote, 
   determine the date and the amount of the Patronage Distribution.  

   2.3.5. Non-Income and Non-Revenue generation Work. 
   
   Not all work at the Collective can generate income or revenue.  
   However, such work must be done: any support services, clerical and 
   bookkeeping, tech support or any other work where NO Services are 
   provided to external Clients, and NO new Products are created for 
   the future revenue streams.  Members working on such non-revenue 
   jobs at the Collective have no less equal rights in their votes 
   than Members working on revenue generating Services and Products.  
   Although it may not be possible at the Bootstrapping Phase of the 
   Collective, the Collective shall set its goal to pay the compensation 
   to Members performing Non-Revenue generating work at the full amount 
   of the Member’s Fair Market Value for such work, without Discount, 
   as defined in the terms of this Agreement.  If the Collective has no 
   sufficient cash reserves to pay such full compensation, Members on 
   the Non-income Programs will be paid the minimally established rate, 
   and the unpaid amounts will be allocated as “Pie Slices” to Members 
   with an additional coefficient for risk, in order to fairly 
   compensate such Members. 
  
   2.3.6. Member’s Work.  
   
   Members have a choice in decision of where they can apply their skills 
   to the benefit of themselves and the Collective.  The Revenue 
   generating Services may be the fastest way for Members to earn income.  
   On the other hand, Members participating in Product development may 
   have a potential to earn higher income in the long run.  If a Product 
   is a success and generates income, Members working on the Product will 
   receive their FMV compensation plus additional distributions from the 
   Surplus calculated based on their “Pie Slices” with additional “at risk” 
   coefficient applied, which, if a Product is highly valued, may be quite 
   substantial.  It is important to understand that a Member’s work, 
   either Revenue generation or Non-Revenue generation, is equally 
   important and valuable to the Collective, and that equality is 
   established through the Programs on which Members can work.  Thus the 
   Surplus that may be earned and generated by some Members is used for 
   rewarding ALL Members, regardless what type of Programs they worked on, 
   but only considering their contributions to the “Pie.”   



2.4. CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS
   
   2.4.1. Capital Account Collective. 
   
   The Collective establishes itself as a “Capital Account 
   Collective/Cooperative.”  It means that the Collective will maintain 
   Capital Accounts for every Member, and each Member’s earnings will 
   be deposited and accounted on his/her Capital Account, which is 
   his/her share of the Collective’s assets.
   
   2.4.2. Virtuality of Capital Accounts.  
   
   For the purpose of this Agreement and general simplification of terms, 
   the concept of Capital Accounts is described in traditional ways: 
   the Collective “creates and opens” Capital Accounts for Members who 
   fund these accounts with their required contributions.  Upon earning 
   any income, the Collective “deposits” the earnings to the Members 
   Capital Accounts.  All Members vote to establish the Patronage 
   Distribution from their Capital Accounts, when all costs and expenses 
   are paid. As a Digital Enterprise, the Collective establishes that 
   the Capital Accounts can be virtualized, stored and managed through 
   the decentralized financial systems, such as cryptocurrency accounts, 
   DeFi (decentralized finance) accounts, electronic bank accounts and/or 
   any other legally permitted in the State of California system.  
   The Collective will develop and maintain a real-time Capital Account 
   management system to simplify allocation of funds, distribution of 
   earnings and payment of patronage dividends. In the initial phases, 
   such system can be disconnected from the actual “store of currency” 
   system (like a bank account or crypocurrency account), but provide 
   just the record or deposits, allocations, and the classification of 
   funds received or paid (for/from which Programs, type of work when 
   revenue received and so on).  In the future, the system will be 
   integrated with the “store of currency” so that any intermediaries 
   (banks, exchanges) will be eliminated.  
   
   2.4.3. Initial Contributions. 
   
   Members shall initially contribute to the Collective’s capital as 
   described in this Agreement.  The Collective’s capital is the 
   cumulative capital in all Members’ Capital Accounts.  
   
   2.4.4. Initial Contribution Amount.  
   
   Every Member shall make an initial capital contribution as established 
   in this Agreement.  This initial investment builds a solid base on 
   which the Members can develop their business. A Member can make 
   his/her capital contribution through a one-time payment or monthly 
   payments over the course of a year.  The Initial Contribution Amount 
   is set at:
   
      $6,000 ($500/month for 12 months)
   
   2.4.5. Annual Membership Fee. 
   The Collective establishes annual membership fee for all active 
   current Members at the rate established in this Agreement.  The 
   annual fee is not a Member’s capital and is accounted as a direct 
   revenue to the Collective to be deposited to the Unallocated Capital 
   Account.  The Annual Membership Fee is set at:
   
      $1,000 (must be paid in full).  
      
   2.4.6. Additional Contributions. 
   
   No Member shall be obligated to make any additional contribution to 
   the Collective's capital without the prior unanimous consent of the 
   Members expressed though a vote. 
   
   2.4.7. Changes to the Capital Accounts.  
   
   The amount in the each Member's Capital Account will go up and down. 
   It will go up when the Surplus is allocated to the Accounts. It will 
   decrease when losses are allocated to the Accounts. 
   
   2.4.8. No Interest on Capital Contributions. 
   
   Members are not entitled to interest or other compensation for or on 
   account of their capital contributions to the Collective except to 
   the extent, if any, expressly provided in this Agreement.  Moreover, 
   the Collective expects that in the Mature Phase, the Capital Accounts 
   may be distributed and managed in decentralized manner, so coordination 
   and establishing a single interest rate on deposits may not be 
   practical.  
   
   2.4.9. No Right to Demand Return of Capital. 
   
   No Member has any right to any return of capital or other distribution 
   except as expressly provided in this Agreement. No Member has any 
   right to close the Capital Account, unless he/she wants to terminate 
   their membership in the Collective.  Terminations are handled in the 
   special clause of the Agreement.
   
   2.4.10. Unallocated Capital Account (UCA).  
   
   Unallocated Capital Account is the general account for the Collective 
   itself, as opposed to the individual Members’ Capital Accounts.  
   UCA shall have different sub-accounts for different accounting 
   purposes.  UCA will be used to deposit the the retained portion of 
   the Surplus and all Profits from Non-Members income before 
   distributions to Members’ Capital Accounts for Patronage Distribution. 
   
   2.4.11. Indivisible Reserve Account (IRA). 
   
   The Collective shall establish an Indivisible Reserve Account as its 
   Capital Account sourced from non-patronage-sourced incomes.  It means 
   that only Profits earned from non-Members’ earnings can be deposited 
   in IRA.  IRA can never be divided among Members.  The Collective can 
   use IRA like any other retained earnings.  IRA is controlled by 
   Members, but not accessible by them for distribution to themselves 
   individually.  “Indivisible” means that upon the Collective’s 
   dissolution or sale, the reserve will go a cooperative development f
   und, a federation or another cooperative organization and not be 
   available to the individual members.  Because IRA can never be 
   cashed out by individual members, it provides long-term investment 
   capital to support the longevity of the Collective, across 
   generations.
   
     2.4.11.1. IRA Designation. 
     
     The Collective designates the Global Digital Apps Cooperative 
     Development organization as the beneficiary of the IRA for its 
     role and contribution in developing this Collective.  
     
   2.4.12. Program Account – The “Well”. 
   
   Upon establishing a Program to support a Value Stream (either 
   Development or Operational, External or Internal), all Members shall 
   approve and vote for a budget to financially support the program.  
   A Program Account, also known as the “Well,” is established to fund 
   the program from the Members’ Capital Accounts.  Multiple Wells can 
   exist and support different Value Streams.   When a Member’s money 
   is allocated from the Capital Account to the Well, it establishes 
   "an investment event.”  The Collective shall track all events in the 
   Program’s life cycle, as far as payment of expenses and receipt of 
   incomes, which will be reflected in the Well.  If a Program includes 
   a Product development, each Product will have its own Well, and 
   Members’ allocation will be tracked per Product in the respective Well.
   
     2.4.12.1. Well Origin. 
     
     “Well” is the term used in the “Slicing Pie” Model, and it is meant 
     to define funding of a risk.  Only Members who allocated funds from 
     their Capital Accounts to the Well will be entitled to 
     profit-sharing from the Program’s revenues recorded in the Well.   
     
     
     
2.5. BUDGETS AND SPENDING
   
   2.5.1. Programs and Budgets. 
   
   The Collective shall establish Programs for any activity that requires 
   allocation of money. Each Program must have a budget estimated and 
   proposed by Members who propose a Program or developed in a 
   collaboration with the Budget Committee, if one already exists. All 
   Members shall vote to approve the budget by a vote of 75% of all 
   active current Members. After the budget is established, an equal 
   llocation of moneys from all Members' Capital Accounts will be made 
   to fund the budget, from which costs and expenses will be paid. 
   
   2.5.2. Programs to support Operations.  
   
   Operations Programs are established to handle only operations and 
   management activities that support the Collective as a whole, 
   including developing capabilities, infrastructure, financial functions, 
   communications, marketing, member management and other existential 
   functions, but are not directly provide for revenue generation. 
   In traditional corporations, these the Cost Centers that provide for
   company’s operations.  The Collective will allocate the budgets for 
   the Operations Programs on regular basis (quarterly, annually).  
   Operations Programs support operational value streams of the 
   Collective itself and the value of the Collective will grow in 
   proportion how well these programs are executed, which in turn allow 
   more efficient execution of the revenue generation programs.
   
   2.5.3. Programs for Revenue generation.  
   
   Revenue generation Programs are established to create and operate 
   value streams, which become sources of revenues for the Collective. 
   Such programs shall focus on maximizing the Surplus (when revenues 
   are allocated to the work of the Members), or the Profits (when 
   revenues are allocated to the work of non-Members/employees).  
   The Surplus from the revenue generation programs will be allocated to 
   the Members' Capital Accounts. Profits from the revenue generation 
   programs will be allocated to the Collective's Unallocated Capital 
   Account.
   
     2.5.3.1. Budgeting Revenue generation Programs.
     
     The complexity of budgeting the Revenue generation Program depends 
     on whether the Program is to generate revenues from Services or 
     from Products that the Collective will create internally and then 
     sell on the market as a subscription.  The Services will generate 
     income from the clients and should, in general, require minimal 
     investment of additional funds.  The Products may require extensive 
     development and costs, so a funded budget is required to run such 
     programs.  The Collective, through the majority vote of Members, 
     shall establish the following model for more complex funding 
     scenarios and shall define if a new Revenue generation Program: 
       
       2.5.3.1.1. requires mandatory fund allocations from all Members 
       (this is the simplest model and it will entail that no 
       additional “Slices” will be given to any Members and after the 
       Surplus is received, it will be allocated at 100% to the total 
       Surplus of the Collective), or
       
       2.5.3.1.2. requires mandatory fund allocations only from the Members 
       working on the Program, or
       
       2.5.3.1.3. requires mandatory fund allocations only from the Members 
       working on the Program but allows voluntary allocation for any 
       other Members, or
       
       2.5.3.1.4. makes the fund allocations voluntary for all Members, 
       whether they work on the Program or not. 
     
     2.5.3.2. Fund Allocations for Products. 
     
     There are two types of allocation required to develop a Product:
      
       2.5.3.2.1. Cash investment from the Capital Accounts
       
       2.5.3.2.2. Labor or effort investment that Members will do applying 
       the “Pie Slices” model, allocating their effort based on their 
       DFVM, the number of hours worked, and the “at risk coefficient, 
       if applicable.
       
     2.5.3.3. Applying “At Risk” Coefficient.
     
     When volunteer funding is specified, Members who contribute funds 
     from their Capital Accounts, whether they will be working on the 
     Program or not, are eligible to apply the “at risk” coefficient to 
     the amount of their Capital Account contribution. The default value 
     for the coefficient applied to “at risk” Cash allocation is: 4.  
     The Collective may change this value by the majority of the vote.  
     This Cash allocation will earn Members additional “Pie Sliced” 
     applied to their general “Slices”.   Thus, under this model, 
     Members can:
     
       2.5.3.3.1. All equally contribute funds from their Capital 
       Accounts and have no “Slices” given to them (no “Slices” and the 
       Surplus from the Program is 100% allocated to the total Surplus 
       for the Collective)
       
       2.5.3.3.2. Only Members working on the Program contribute funds and 
       receive “Slices” for every dollar allocated from their Capital 
       Account with the “at risk” coefficient
       
       2.5.3.3.3. As in # 2 above but also with Members not working on the 
       Program but also receiving “Slices”, just as the Members working 
       on the Program.
       
       2.5.3.3.4. As in # 2 and # 3 above: all “investing” Members receive 
       “Slices” with the “at risk” coefficient.
     
     2.5.3.4. Surplus Distribution Rules. 
     
     The Collective shall also determine, prior to the start of the 
     Program, if the Surplus from the Program should be distributed among 
     the Members who contributed funds from their Capital Accounts and 
     effort (labor) or the Surplus should be applied to the general 
     Surplus pool for the entire Collective, from which Patronage 
     Distributions will be made for all Members.  If the Collective 
     decides that the Program’s Surplus must be distributed only to 
     those Members who contributed funds and effort (labor), the 
     Collective shall retain 25% of the Program Surplus to be combined 
     with the total Collective’s Surplus, and the remaining 75% will 
     be eligible for distribution to the participating Members, based 
     on the “Pie Slices” model from the Program’s “Pie.”  
     
     The Collective shall delegate to the Members who contributed to 
     the Program to decide if they want to distribute the entire Surplus 
     or, if the it is a long-running Program, distribute only part of 
     the Surplus and retain the remainder for future funding of the 
     Program.  The default Collective’s policy is to distribute the 
     entire Surplus for each time period. 
   
   
   
2.6. ALLOCATION OF SURPLUS, PROFITS AND LOSSES; PATRONAGE DISTRIBUTIONS

   
   2.6.1. Surplus. 
   
   Any amount earned by a Member above the DFMV is the Surplus. The 
   Surplus is allocated to the respective Member’s Capital Account.  
   The initial amount of the Capital Account and the earned Surplus will 
   be the base for funding the Collective’s Programs and investing in 
   growth and development of the organization.  Members are eligible to 
   receive distributions from the Surplus as described in the Patronage 
   Distributions clause of the Agreement.
   
     2.6.1.1. Member’s No Rights to Surplus. 
     
     No Member of this Collective shall have a right to demand and 
     receive the Surplus distribution, even in the amount and to the 
     extend of his/her own share of the Surplus earned on a revenue 
     generation Program.  The Surplus is the contribution of each Member 
     to the Collective to support the cause and goals of the objective. 
   
   2.6.2. Profits.  
   
   Profit is the net revenue (after paying costs and expenses) earned by 
   a Non-Member above the non-Member’s DFMV rate.  Profits from a 
   Non-Member’s labor are not eligible for distribution to Members 
   (unlike the Surplus), and hence must remain in the Collective’s 
   Reserve Fund.  Profits shall be used for development, business growth 
   or benefits for all workers in the Collective (Members and 
   non-Members).
   
     2.6.2.1. Member’s and Worker’s No Right to Profits. 
     
     Neither Members nor Non-Members workers of this Collective shall 
     have a right to distributions from Profits.  Profits are the earned 
     assets that can only be used for development of the Collective or 
     for benefits to all who work at the Collective, but not in the 
     form of direct cash distributions. 
   
   2.6.3. Patronage Distributions. 
   
   Members shall, after calculating and paying costs, expenses, funding 
   the on-going Programs and other allocations related to the health of 
   the Collective, determine the amount of Surplus distribution to be 
   aid out, if any. Patronage Distribution decision should be made at 
   least once a year. Available funds, as referred to herein, shall mean 
   the net cash of the Collective available after appropriate provision 
   for expenses and liabilities, as determined by the Members. The vote 
   of 75% of current active Members is required to approve the Patronage 
   Distribution.
   
   2.6.4. Recurrent Costs. 
   
   The Collective allocates funds for operating its value streams through 
   Programs approved and voted in by the Members.  The Collective is a 
   for-profit organization and the total amount of revenues must cover 
   all costs and expenses.  The Programs for the internal operational 
   value streams (operations, marketing, communications, internal 
   development, support and membership programs) are not designed to 
   generate revenues directly and will always be the Recurrent Costs 
   Programs.  Members allocate equal proportion of their capital, 
   from their Capital Amounts, to such programs.  
   
   2.6.5. Losses instead of Revenues. 
   
   If the Collective operates the Revenue generation Programs, such that 
   the costs of the program exceed the earned revenues, a Loss occurs.  
   There will be no revenue to compensate the amounts spent from the 
   budgets on these programs, and no allocation to the Members' Capital 
   Accounts or the Unallocated Capital Account would occur. Members shall 
   continuously evaluate Programs, through quarterly and annual reports 
   y Officers and Managers elected to run them, to determine if further 
   support of such programs is justified.  
   
      2.6.5.1. Losses and Liability Protection. 
      
      The Revenue generation Programs are the fundamental programs for 
      sufficiency and prosperity of the Collective and all its Members.  
      Members may allocate unequal amounts or no money at all to the 
      Revenue generation Programs to support the initial bootstrapping 
      until the programs become self-sufficient.  The proportion of their 
      contribution (with the additional coefficient added for their 
      risk) to the revenue-generating program over the total contribution 
      by all Members will determine their proportion in the Surplus or 
      Loss as the outcome of the Program.  If a Program sustained a 
      Loss and there are outstanding debts, all Members of the Collective 
      shall decide by 75% vote if additional funds should be provided to 
      the Program by allocating equal proportion from all Members in the 
      Collective to cover any liabilities and keep the Collective 
      warranted from any possible legal action. 
   
   2.6.6. No Forced Distributions.
   
   The Collective shall not make mandatory annual distributions.  Members 
   shall decide by the 75% vote, if Patronage Distributions should take 
   place, the amount or percentage of distribution and the date and time 
   of the distribution to be executed.
   
   2.6.7. Acceptance of Distributions.
   
   Member has the right to refuse accepting the Patronage Distribution 
   for the specified period.  The undistributed amounts of the Patronage 
   Distribution will remain on the Member’s Capital Account.  Members 
   agree to consult with their Tax Advisor about the implications of not 
   accepting the distribution.  The Collective shall act in the interest 
   of the organization in all tax related issues, and in case of 
   non-distributed Surplus, will pay any tax levied on such amounts, 
   as per the IRS regulations to keep the organization in good standing 
   with the IRS. 
   
   2.6.8. Charging Orders and Foreclosure.
   
   The Collective shall not abide by any Charging Order (a debtor’s lien) 
   against any of its Members in regards to the distribution of Member’s 
   patronage, and Member may choose to refuse acceptance of the Patronage 
   Distribution to avoid paying the debtor.  In case the debtor initiates 
   a legal foreclosure procedure against the Member, the Collective may 
   choose to terminate such Member, with all termination consequences for 
   Involuntary Termination set in this Agreement, in order to protect 
   the Collective and all other Members from any financial liability and 
   other potential losses.  Each Member shall protect the Collective from 
   any negative consequences of the Member’s personal actions or 
   liabilities.
   
   2.6.9. Non Pro Rata Distributions.
   
   All Patronage Distributions in the Collective will be calculated based 
   on each Member’s amount of the earned “Pie Slices” and their FMV.  
   This means that the distributions will NOT be equal. 
   
   2.6.10. Guaranteed Payments.
   
   If the Collective has a sustained revenue stream from the Surplus 
   generated through Members’ work on the Revenue generation Programs, 
   the Collective shall establish the "guaranteed payments" schedule to 
   pay the Members working on the internal Operations Programs.  
   The guaranteed payments will be based on the number of "Pie Slices" 
   earned by Members, and the amount of “Slices” will be reduced from 
   the total Member’s amount of “Slices” to be used for the annual 
   Patronage Distribution. This will reduce the overall Surplace 
   allocated to the Capital Accounts at the end of each quarter, but it 
   will give all Members a more stable income.
   
   
   
2.7. RESERVE CAPITAL ACCOUNT AND RESERVE FUND
   
   2.7.1. Reserve Fund.
   
   Members shall agree to grow the Capital Account until the Collective 
   has a reserve sufficient to pay for 3 months of expenses. The reserve 
   fund lives within the Capital Accounts (it is the Reserve Capital 
   Account) because it grows from the Surplus allocated, but not 
   distributed, to Members, and from the Members' initial capital 
   investments. 
   
   2.7.2. Surplus Allocation to the Reserve Fund. 
   
   The Reserve Capital Account should be accounted separately from the 
   General Capital Accounts total amount that is the sum of all Members' 
   contributions. Each Member has the responsibility to allocate his/her 
   equal share to the Reserve Capital Account. 
   
   2.7.3. Profits Allocations to the Reserve Fund.
   
   Profits from Non-Members’ earnings are allocated in the Collective’s 
   Reserve Fund.  It is the Reserve Capital Account for the entire 
   organization.   The total amount of money on all Reserve accounts 
   should cover 3 months of operations.
   
   2.7.4. Virtuality of the Reserve Fund.
   
   The concept of the Collective’s Reserve Fund and the Members’ Reserve 
   Funds (as part of the Capital Accounts) is virtual and physical 
   location of moneys, accounts, funds shall be determined by the 
   Collective as a part of its decentralized nature.  The Reserve Fund 
   amount can be dynamically calculated and verified by all Members. 
   
   
   
2.8. MEMBER’S CAPITAL ACCOUNT AND TERMINATION

   2.8.1. Capital Account to Loan Conversion.
   
   When a Member ends his/her membership, voluntary or involuntary, 
   his/her Capital Account and other debts the Collective owes the Member 
   are turned into a loan to the Collective that must be paid to the 
   Member within five years (5) or less. The loan will not accumulate 
   interest during the first year. After the first year, it will 
   accumulate interest at a rate of 3% on the outstanding amount. 
   
   2.8.2. Loan Interest Rate.
   
   Members shall establish the loan rate in January of every year based 
   on the 30-year fixed mortgage rate current at the time of voting. 
   Members are allowed to modify the rate within 10% margin of the 
   current 30-year fixed mortgage rate. Members vote by simple majority 
   to set the rate for the current year for all inner-Collective loans 
   (like the loan resulted from the Capital Account conversion due to 
   Member's termination) that will occur during the current year.
   
   2.8.3. Allocation of Loans.
   
   All funds from the Members’ Capital Accounts converted to loans due 
   to Member’s termination or other reasons, are subject to required 
   allocations of funds for all mandatory Programs (like the internal 
   Operational Programs) and any other required allocations for all 
   Members, as voted by the active current Members in good standing.  
   Loans are not eligible to be allocated to Programs that allow 
   volunteer allocation by Members.
   
   2.8.4.  Modifications to the Loan Clause.
   
   Members shall NOT modify this provision in this Agreement unless 75% 
   of all active current Members request this clause to be reviewed and 
   modified.  Unanimous vote of all active current Members is required 
   to change this clause.  Capital Accounts are the Member’s commitment 
   to the Cooperative Economics and this Collective in particular, and 
   they should not be easily terminated, dissolved and distributed.  
   However, they are the property of the Members, and as such they 
   should be returned to Members, upon their termination at the 
   Collective, in a phased manner.  



2.9. CONTRACTS AND SIGNATURES

   2.9.1. Contracts.
   
   "Contracts" are binding obligations established between the Collective 
   and external entities, either partners, suppliers, contractors or 
   clients. Contracts can apply to the Collective at large or to specific 
   Members and/or Teams of the Collective.
   
     2.9.1.1. Managed Investment Contracts (MIC).
   
     The Collective shall advocate use of the Managed Investment Contracts 
     in order to delivery products and services to Clients.  MIC enables 
     lean-agile delivery while emphasizing the Client’s control over Spend, 
     and allows to keep cohesive and highly effective teams together 
     through the entire Program.
   
   2.9.2. The General Provision for Contacts.
   
   Every Member must abstain from establishing contracts or taking 
   actions that bind the Collective at large without the authorization 
   through the all Members' vote or by a Committee, established by 
   Members to manage contracts, sales and clients or suppliers relations 
   in the manner described in this Agreement. 
   
   2.9.3. Contract-signing Role.
   
   Individual Members can, through the established general Members vote, 
   e given specific responsibilities for entering into contract with 
   external entities, and such responsibilities can be set with a limit 
   on the amount of money, duration, or any other constraints, in order 
   to regulate the scope of financial or other liabilities for the 
   Collective under such contracts.
   
   2.9.4. Committee’s Signature Authority.
   
   Members, through the established general Members’ vote, can establish 
   that a Committee or a Team to have authority to enter into contracts 
   of higher value and longer duration, with the implications to the 
   entire Collective, if needed, by designating the entire Committee or 
   the Team or a specified number of members of such entity to jointly 
   enter into a contract ("multi-signature" authorization).
   
   2.9.5. Team’s Signature Authority.
   
   The Collective delegates the authority for self-determination, 
   self-governance and self-regulation, regarding the capacity to develop 
   and deliver products and services to Clients, to a Team of individual 
   Members or a Team of teams of Members who band to collaborate and 
   establish a mostly permanent highly-efficient sub-collectives 
   dedicated to specific industry, location or client.  The Collective 
   should designate such teams to have this authority by creating 
   Programs, agreed upon and voted in by Members, of which the Team or 
   Teams will be responsible for revenues.  Such teams, whether they 
   choose to branch out into an autonomous Federated Collective or to 
   continue as individual Members of this Collective working on the 
   established Program, shall have the power to enter into Contracts 
   with external entities, either for rendering services, building 
   products or purchasing materials and services, required for their 
   xecution of the established Program.  The Collective delegates the 
   power to establish the internal Contract-signing authority in teams, 
   as long as such authority only applies to and is constrained by the 
   established Program.
   
   2.9.6. Individual Contracts.
   
   Any natural person Member of the Collective can enter into a binding 
   contract that specifically designates this Member as the party 
   responsible for the obligations stated in the contract. Such Contract 
   must specifically state that the Member is solely responsible for 
   delivering any services and work products under such Contract and 
   that the Member releases the Collective from any liability for any 
   actions or lack thereof, that may affect the Collective's financial 
   or legal obligations under the Contract.  When entering into 
   Individual Contracts, Members should negotiate the full FMV rate 
   (the DFMV plus the Surplus) with Clients.  Although the Collective, 
   in general, does not prohibit individual Members to enter into their 
   own contracts with Clients, the Collective discourages such contracts 
   and instead recommends that Members join in Teams and engage with 
   Clients through the Managed Investment Contracts, which are not 
   possible when a single individual sells his/her competency to the 
   Client for a period of time.  Through MIC, the Collective can charge 
   premium rates and avoid the market pressure to reduce rates when 
   competing under the “body-shop” model.
   
   2.9.7. Signatures.
   
   The Collective shall recognize that the concept of a Signature can 
   be applied in the digital and the traditional realm of the Collective’s 
   operations.
   
     2.9.7.1. Signatures – Conventional.
     
     "Signatures" are authorizations for issuing payments or entering 
     into binding contracts with financial and legal obligations. 
     Contracts affecting the Collective at large require "multi-signature" 
     format from several Members, as established in this Agreement.  
     Signatures can be written on paper documents or via electronic 
     edia, like DocuSign or other tools, recognized by the State of 
     California and by the external partners, suppliers, and clients of 
     the Collective.
     
     2.9.7.2. Signatures – Digital Realm.
     
     The Collective shall develop and apply for any internal and external 
     document, agreement, decision, communication or statement, the 100% 
     digital method of “signing” a document as a verifiable proof of 
     identity of the signer, with tamper-proof and non-repudiation 
     quality of the material signed.  The Collective shall implement the 
     cryptographic key management and digital signature management 
     infrastructure as the core platform for its operations, to 
     strengthen security, build trust, and allow continuous automation 
     of all processes when consensus and decision-making is required.



2.10. INDEMNIFICATION

   2.10.1. Indemnification. 
   
   The Collective shall indemnify any person who was or is a party 
   defendant or is threatened to be made a party defendant, pending or 
   completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, 
   administrative, or investigative (other than an action by or in the 
   right of the Collective) by reason of the fact that he/she is or was 
   a Member of the Collective, Manager, Officer, employee or agent of 
   the Collective, or is or was serving at the request of the Collective, 
   against expenses (including attorney's fees), judgments, fines, and 
   amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred in 
   connection with such action, suit or proceeding if the Members 
   determine that he acted in good faith and in a manner he/she 
   reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interest of 
   the Collective, and with respect to any criminal action proceeding, 
   has no reasonable cause to believe his/her conduct was unlawful. The 
   termination of any action, suit, or proceeding by judgment, order, 
   settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of "nolo contendere" or its 
   equivalent, shall not in itself create a presumption that the person 
   did or did not act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably 
   believed to be in the best interest of the Collective, and, with 
   respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause 
   to believe that his/her conduct was lawful.



2.11. SALARIES, REIMBURSEMENT, AND PAYMENT OF EXPENSES

   2.11.1. Organization Expenses.
   
   All expenses incurred in connection with organization of the 
   Collective shall be paid by the Collective from the established 
   Members’ Capital Accounts and the Membership fee payments to the 
   Collectives Unallocated Capital Account.
   
   2.11.2. Salary.
   
   No salary shall be paid to a Member for the performance of his or her 
   duties under this Agreement unless the salary has been approved the 
   majority of the Members, and such record of the approved salaries and 
   roles, eligible for the salary payment, has been appended to this 
   Agreement.  The Collective shall defer establishing Salary/Payroll 
   until the level of maturity and stability of the organization has 
   been achieved, when there are sufficient funds to establish the 
   payroll with all necessary tax and social security payments.  
   The Members, acting in the roles eligible for salary payments, shall 
   have the option to opt out from receiving salaries and continue 
   receive all their income as Patronage Distributions with all tax 
   implications thereof.
   
   2.11.3. Legal and Accounting Services.
   
   TThe Collective may obtain legal and accounting services to the extent 
   reasonably necessary for the conduct of the Collective's business.  
   All legal and accounting services shall be paid from Members’ 
   Capital Accounts.  
   
   2.11.4. “Day to Day” Costs and Expenses.
   
   The Collective shall establish Programs and allocate budgets to such 
   Programs for any function or line of business activity within the 
   Collective.  The Members elected to manage such Programs and Budgets 
   will be responsible for authorizing payments for Cost and Expenses 
   from the Budgets of the these Programs.  
   
   2.11.5. Emergency and Unforeseen Expenses.
   
   In case of emergency or unforeseen expenses, when the Collective must 
   pay to support the Collective’s business and operations, and when 
   there is no time to conduct Members’ vote on the issue, the Collective 
   shall authorize that at least three (3) Founding Members provide the 
   authorization for payment.  
   
   2.11.6. Rights for Expense Reimbursement.
   
   When expenses and costs are incurred by Members directly from their 
   personal accounts and NOT from the Capital Accounts, held in the 
   Collective, and when such costs are directly related to the 
   Collective’s business, operations and the established Programs, for 
   which budgets have been allocated and voted on, the Member, who has 
   paid for the expense, has the right to be reimbursed upon a proof of 
   payment.
   
   2.11.7. Compensation of Members.
   
     2.11.7.1. Members will regularly make decisions about the money to 
     be spent, how much to pay each Member directly, and how much money 
     to save in the Capital Accounts.
     
     2.11.7.2. Members recognize that they have conscientiously elected 
     to operate in a cooperative way, which is distinct from conventional 
     business and employment model (capital owners vs. wage workers).  
     
     2.11.7.3. In many conventional companies, owners receive all of 
     the profits in proportion to their investments. In a worker 
     cooperative, the profits are distributed in proportion to the value 
     and quantity of work done by a cooperative partner - a Member in 
     the Collective. Towards this end, the Collective has adopted 
     financial provisions, as described in this Agreement, that serve 
     to distribute the gains from the business (the Surplus) in the 
     cooperative way.  In short, neither investing money, nor simply 
     being a Member of the Collective, without contribution of effort, 
     shall make a Member eligible to receive benefits in the form of 
     Patronage Distributions. 
     
   
   2.11.8. Equal Pay for Equal Work.
     
     2.11.8.1. Unlike traditional corporate and/or private companies, 
     which can only hypocritically declare the principle of "Equal Pay 
     for Equal Work,” which in reality cannot be implemented because 
     the corporate owner retains a large part of the value, created by 
     workers, in the form of the profits which are beyond the control 
     of the workers, the Collective is founded on the fair, equitable 
     and truly democratic model of providing its Workers-Members-Owners 
     true control over the Collective’s gains (and losses).  
     
     2.11.8.2. However, how can "equal pay" be established when all 
     Members differ from each other in their education, level of skills 
     and experience?  Moreover, not all Members can and will work the 
     same number of hours, or work in the same roles.  
     
     2.11.8.3. In order to address these issues, the Collective 
     establishes the following provisions:
     
       2.11.8.3.1. The Collective shall establish a reference model of 
       a Fair Market Value for all skills and professions that its 
       Members may possess. Fair Market Value (FMV) is defined as the 
       amount of money that the "Market" will pay for a worker's skills 
       in an average hourly rate for the specific industry or occupation, 
       if a worker is employed by a company as an independent contractor, 
       and not as an employee. 
       
       2.11.8.3.2. Members shall establish their compensation rate based 
       on FMV for their personal skills and experience in a specific 
       knowledge domain or industry to which such skills may apply. 
       A Member's FMV must be discounted to allow for a Surplus to be 
       earned for the Member and the Collective, so their rate, to be 
       distributed to the Member upon a payment from Client, is a 
       "Discounted Fair Market Value” – DFMV.  The same DFMV is applied 
       when calculating the Member’s contribution on the internal 
       Programs or Product development (when there is no way to 
       determine the revenue from the sale of the Product).
       
       2.11.8.3.3. The Collective applies the "Surplus" on top of the 
       DFMV of every Member who is working and billing external clients. 
       For any work that a Member performs under internal programs, only 
       the DFMV rate is applied in calculating Member's contributions. 
       There is no Surplus on the contributions that a Member makes to 
       the Collective or working on Products for future sale.  Payment 
       of DFMV rate to a Member is accounted as Patronage Distributions 
       and should not be considered a "salary," unless different 
       provisions are established under this Agreement. 
       
       2.11.8.3.4. The DFMV part of the total amount used for billing 
       rate calculation to external Clients, and received as revenue 
       payments from external Client (which also includes the Surplus 
       Margin), is paid to every Member working on the external Program, 
       created for this client, upon receipt of payment from the client 
       (weekly, bi-weekly or monthly). 
       
       2.11.8.3.5. The Surplus is directly contributed to the Member's 
       Capital Account and remains accounted on the Capital Account 
       until all Members vote for Patronage Distribution at least once 
       a year, as per the provisions established in this Agreement.
       
       2.11.8.3.6. The Collective shall allow Patronage Distributions 
       from the Members' Capital Accounts only when all operational 
       and business costs are paid for the given period. 
       
       2.11.8.3.7. Both, the DFMV and the Patronage Distributions, are 
       "pass through" distributions from the Collective to Members. 
       Members are responsible for declaring and paying their taxes. 
       The Collective shall report all distributions to the IRS or 
       other tax and financial authorities of the United States, 
       the State of California or other states, as per Member's place of 
       residence, business location (for income generation) or other 
       provisions of the law. 
       
       2.11.8.3.8. The Collective uses the "The Slicing Pie" model to 
       determine each Member's contribution to the total value of the 
       Collective (through its Capital Account contribution). 
       The Slicing Pie model is described in this Agreement.
       
   2.11.9. Calculating Member’s Contributions – “Pie Slicing” Model
     
     2.11.9.1. The Slicing Pie Model is a dynamic equity calculation 
     model created for early start-ups when it is hard to establish 
     up-front equity distribution between founders, early employees 
     and other contributors working for "sweat equity" and at risk. 
     
     2.11.9.2. The key concept of the Slicing Pie model is a “Slice”, 
     which is a fictional unit of measure for an individual’s 
     contributions to an “at risk” venture, with the known, established 
     and agree upon between the individual and other members of the 
     work group, his/her Fair Market Value for skills and experience 
     he/she possess. A Slice does not represent equity or has a value 
     (in dollars or other currency). The purpose of a Slice is to help 
     calculate percentages of the individual’s contribution to the total 
     contributions of all workers combined: 
     
       Partner's Share = Partner's Slices / All Slices
     
     2.11.9.3. In terms of the Collective, the Slicing Pie Model helps 
     to determine a Member's "at risk" contribution in relation to all 
     other Members' contributions. "At risk" means that although the 
     Member performed the work for the Collective (e.g. on an internal 
     Program or a new Product, to be sold on the market in the future), 
     the Member has not been paid yet. Such unpaid contributions will 
     be counted as the “Ingredients” that will go into “baking” the 
     “Pie.”  The Contribution (“Ingredient”) is defined as: 
     
       1 Contribution (Ingredient) = 
            DFMV * 1 hour of work * 1 (“at risk” coefficient)
     
     The Collective shall establish the “at risk” coefficient for each 
     Program.  The default value is: 1 (one). 
     
     2.11.9.4. The formula for Member’s total contributions (with 
     default “at risk” coefficient): 
     
       Member’s Total Contributions = 
            Member’s DFMV * Total Hours Worked
     
     2.11.9.5. DFMV is established in US Dollars, however when they 
     are used to calculate Contributions (and subsequently the Slices), 
     the Dollar attribute is dropped, and Contributions become abstract 
     units. 
     
     2.11.9.6. The value of the “Pie” is the sum of all Contributions 
     from all Members at any given time. The value of the individual 
     Member’s contribution, now can be defined as “Slices” of the “Pie” 
     that is the percentage of the individual contributions over all 
     Members’ contributions:
     
       Member’s Slices = 
            Member’s Contributions / Total of ALL Members’ Contributions
     
     2.11.9.7. “Slice” is a dynamic unit and must be calculated every 
     time a Patronage Distribution is scheduled to take place.  
     When Members decide through voting on the amount of Surplus to be 
     distributed to Members, each individual amount (in Dollars) will 
     be calculated according to this formula:
     
       Member’s Distribution (in $$$) = 
            Total Surplus for Distribution * Member’s Slices
     
     2.11.9.8. The Collective shall record and keep track of all 
     Contributions  for all Members, current and retired, for the 
     life time of the Collective until its termination or dissolution, 
     under the terms of this Agreement.  



SECTION 3:  MEMBERSHIP AND PATRONAGE

3.1. FOUNDING MEMBERS – BOOTSTRAPPING THE COLLECTIVE

   3.1.1. Founding Members.
   
   "Founding Members" is the class of Worker-Members and Owners in the 
   Collective that created the Collective, wrote the initial version of 
   this Agreement and bootstrapped the operations of the Collective to 
   the level described in the Vision Document that accompanies this 
   Agreement. Founding Members pledge to the Principals of the Digital
   Workers Cooperative stated in the Vision Document and commit to the 
   growth and prosperity of Collective as stated therein.
   
   3.1.2. Founding Members' Rights.
   
   Founding Members have all the rights and responsibilities of the 
   general Members under this Agreement, in addition they: 
   
     3.1.2.1. Can arbitrate any internal conflict between Members or 
     Members and the Collective;
     
     3.1.2.2. Can veto any decision by Workers-Members, either done 
     individually (in the course of Worker-Member's operations) or 
     collectively through Workers-Members voting process. To veto a 
     Workers-Members decision that was voted on by the simple majority 
     vote, the Founding Members must have a Veto Vote of at least 75% 
     all active and current Founding Members.  Decisions made 
     collectively by the unanimous vote of the Members (100%) cannot be 
     vetoed by the Founding Members.  
     
     3.1.2.3. Must approve nomination of a Worker-Member to a Founding 
     Member rank when a new branch, division, subsidiary or business 
     unit of the Collective is created of which the Worker-Member is 
     a creator, initiator, leader or otherwise designated to lead, 
     create, bootstrap or manage it. 
     
     3.1.2.4. Cannot sell, transfer, pass on or otherwise relinquish 
     their Founding Member status to any other Worker-Member or any 
     person or entity outside of the Collective. 



3.2. MEMBERS - WORKER-MEMBERS – PARTNERS - PATRONS

   3.2.1. Synonyms of Member.
   
   "Members", "Worker-Members", "Partners" and “Patrons” are synonymous 
   in the context of this Agreement (hereinafter referred to as 
   “Members”) and define the class of owners of the Collective that 
   have the "stake of work" (and not the "stake of assets/stock").  
   It meaning that they work for the Collective either generating revenue 
   from external clients or building value of the Collective through 
   internal programs, products and services to be consumed by all Members 
   internally or to be offered to the Collective’s external clients as 
   Products.
   
   3.2.2. Current and Active.
   
   Members are "current" and "active" if they have been accepted into 
   the Collective by the majority vote of other Workers-Members, paid 
   their annual Membership dues/fees, made their Capital Account 
   contribution in cash (or as otherwise established by the Collective) 
   and are contributing at least 20 hours per week to the business of 
   the Collective. This contribution can be external ("revenue generation" 
   from external clients) or internal (developing the Collective’s 
   programs and services for internal use or to be offered to external 
   clients in the future). 
   
   3.2.3. Work Effort Requirement.
   
   The Collective shall review the required contribution “work effort 
   contributions” (calculated in hours worked) every 12 months to ensure 
   that the Members generate enough value for the Collective.  During 
   the Bootstrapping phase, the lower amount of hours may help Members 
   to keep another job, as the revenue stream in the Collective may not 
   be stable yet.  The Collective shall aim at establishing 35-38 
   hours/week requirement when fully operational and self-sustained. 
   
   3.2.4. Past Members
   
     3.2.4.1. This Digital Knowledge Workers Collective is different 
     from other collectives in non-digital industries, because it 
     provides the former Members of the Collective to participate in 
     sharing the value created, if the Collective to be sold.  
     Past Members are entitled to receive their share of the proceeds 
     from the sale of the Collective, calculated on the base of their 
     “Pie Slices” contributions in percentage to all other past and 
     present  Members. 
     
     3.2.4.2. The Collective shall maintain a list of all past Members, 
     including names, last known address, telephone number, e-mail 
     address, Member's Designated Beneficiary for the payment of the 
     Capital Account after the Member's death and for distribution after 
     dissolution, membership dates, Member's Fair Market Value (FMV) 
     rate and the total number of hours worked and the total amount of 
     "Pie Slices" earned at each FMV during their entire membership.
     
     3.2.4.3. This Agreement is binding to Member's Successors. The 
     terms and conditions contained in the Agreement apply to and are 
     binding to the Member's successors, assignee, executors, 
     administrators, beneficiaries, and representatives. This refers 
     to the persons that inherits a Member's interest in the Collective 
     upon death or legally established incompetency. 
     
     3.2.4.4. Member's membership in this Collective in not transferable 
     to any person through sale, inheritance or otherwise. If an active 
     Member is diseased or deemed incompetent or disabled to conduct 
     his/her business with the Collective due to medical or health 
     reasons, the Member will be considered as "a voluntarily resigned" 
     with all rights, benefits and responsibilities, as stated in this 
     Agreement. 



3.3. EQUAL POWER - ONE VOTE

   3.3.1. One Vote.
   
   Every active current Member of the Collective in good standing, 
   regardless class or category, has ONE VOTE - and one vote ONLY - 
   to vote on any issue that requires a collective decision-making. 
   But the power and influence that every Member has is much greater 
   than the simple capacity to vote. 
   
   3.3.2. Owner/Operator Mindset.
   
   Every Member pledges to work for the benefit of the organization as a 
   whole by creating and increasing the value of the Collective’s 
   products, capabilities and services.  Members continuously learn and 
   improve their "business owner" and "entrepreneur" mindset and the 
   character of a responsible business operator. 
   
   3.3.3. Initiative-driven Organization.
   
   To promote a culture in which every Member is motivated and encouraged 
   to participate in the management of the Collective, every Member 
   can - and must - propose policies and activities to improve the 
   Collective's functioning. When such proposal are approved by the vote 
   of Members, the proposing Member is encouraged to take the lead and 
   manage the initiative. 



3.4. OWNERSHIP MINDSET AND LEADERSHIP

   3.4.1. Owners.
   
   Members are the OWNERS of the Collective. They are not employees. 
   That means that each and every Members in the Collective is 
   responsible for managing the Cooperative.  “Managing” means 
   collaborating on solutions, voting on decisions, leading towards 
   established goals by transforming outputs to value-creating 
   outcomes.
   
   3.4.2. Partners, NOT Employees.
   
   Since the Members are "Partners" in this Limited Liability Company, 
   and as such, are the OWNERS and MANAGERS of the Collective, nobody 
   employs them. The Partners are not employees. 
   
   3.4.3. Proposals.
   
   The OWNERS of the Collective make collective and democratic decisions 
   about the organization of the cooperative, its Business Strategy, 
   its Programs and Products and Services, its internal policies and 
   rules. Proposals for all matters that require decision-making and 
   vote by OWNERS will be prepared by Members who are qualified 
   professionals in the related field, or Members who believe that 
   they have valid and sound ideas that can benefit the Collective as 
   a whole. If proposals are accepted, it is expected that the proposing 
   Members take on the responsibility to carry out such decisions, form 
   the necessary Committees and manage budgets and funds required for 
   achieving the set goals.
   
   3.4.4. Leadership.
   
   The Collective recognizes Leadership as the characteristic necessary 
   to grow, improve and make the company a success, both economically 
   and socially. As all fundamental decisions are done in a collective 
   democratic way, Leadership in execution of programs and applying the 
   strategies, policies and procedures is recognized and welcomed. 
   
   3.4.5. Opportunity to Lead.
   
   Members with appropriate skills in Leadership will be tasked to lead 
   initial efforts. It is expected that all Members will be developing 
   leadership skills and expertise in delivering programs and creating value.  
   
   3.4.6. Three Success Factors.
   
   The Collective establishes that Consensus, Trust and Commitment are 
   the key success factors in properly applying Leadership and Ownership 
   Mindset to accomplishing any tasks or program in the Collective, 
   either on internal endeavor or for external Clients. 
   
   
   
3.5. EMPLOYMENT AND EMPLOYEES

   3.5.1. Employee Definition.
   
   People working for the Cooperative who are not Workers-Members, as 
   per the terms of this Agreement, are “Employees.”  The Collective 
   shall require that these conditions must be met to allow Employees:
   
     3.5.1.1. The Collective must achieve economic solvency and have 
     sufficient income to establish payroll.
     
     3.5.1.2. The Collective’s Employees must be paid a full negotiated 
     salary/wage from day one and all necessary payroll and other taxes 
     must be paid to Federal Government and the State of California.
     
   3.5.2. Employee’s Path to Membership.
   
   Members intend to avoid treating anybody else like an employee, 
   except on a temporary basis. For this reason, the people that will 
   work long-term for the Collective in the future must be given a 
   path to be converted into Members, if they prefer. The objective 
   is to operate a business that eliminates the division between 
   workers and owners. 



3.6. BECOMING A MEMBER

   3.6.1. Collective’s Spirit.
   
   The opportunity to be a co-owner of a collective business where one 
   can be fully in charge of the results of one’s labor is the main 
   attraction to cooperative movement.  However, starting a business 
   from the ground up is a difficult task.  Ideally, people who join 
   the Collective are invited by their friends and colleagues already 
   working with it.  At the initiation however, the Collective shall be 
   open to people who never worked with each other.   The Founding 
   Members shall thoroughly screen and validate the early-joiners in 
   order to ensure that they will fit in with the Collective's culture, 
   possess the needed skills to bootstrap the Collective and build the 
   initial capabilities for growth.
   
   3.6.2. Accepting the Agreement.
   
   The Collective starts with collaboration of the like-minded Founding 
   Members who agree to the Digital Knowledge Workers Cooperative 
   Principles, adapt the initial Agreement, define and establish the 
   initial focus areas for building and establishing the Collective’s 
   Value Streams, products, services and revenue opportunities, as well 
   as internal organization and structures to support the above efforts.  
   
   3.6.3. Core Priorities and Objectives.
   
   Each Founding Member can be assigned or carve for himself/herself 
   the focus area or domain that is important for the Collective and 
   will increase its value.   Each Candidate Founding Member will submit 
   a statement of his/her interest to contribute to creation, grow and 
   prosperity of the Collective, along with specific skills and 
   experience required to manage the specified domain (or focus area) 
   in the bootstrap period.  
   
   3.6.4. Initial Domains.
   
   In the Bootstrap phase, the initial focus domains shall be:
     
     - Organizational development (including systems, processes, operations)
     - Products and Services
     - Marketing and External Communications
     - Sales and Revenue Streams
     - Recruitment / On-boarding
   
   3.6.5. Financial Structures Priority.
   
   Founding Members establish the system of Members’ Capital Accounts, 
   the Unallocated Capital Account and the Reserve Fund in order to 
   finance the bootstrapping process and cover the initial costs of 
   the Collective.
   
   3.6.6. Division of Responsibilities.
   
   The Collective shall allow 10-20 initial Founding Members to divide 
   the roles and responsibilities for bootstrapping operations.  
   
   3.6.7. Membership Application Process.
   
   Candidate Worker-Members who want to join the Collective will submit 
   an application stating their interest and their skills (or desire to 
   acquire such skills) in the domains that are important to creation 
   and growth of the Collective.  Candidate Workers-Members must conduct 
   in-person interviews with at least three (3) Founding Members if the 
   total number of active current Members is under 50 people.   When the
   number of Members (including Founding Members) grows over 50 people, 
   each Candidate Worker-Member must be interviewed by at least 
   three (3) current active Worker-Members designated for recruitment 
   and on-boarding and one (1) Founding Member approving or vetoing 
   the candidacy.   All current and active Workers-Members vote to 
   accept a new Worker-Member who must fulfill all requirements of 
   becoming a Member. 
   
   3.6.8.  Mandatory Training.
   
   The Collective establishes that every newly accepted Member must 
   undergo a training on how to succeed in the Collective by creating 
   value for himself/herself, the Collective, other Members and its 
   clients and customers.   This training will be continuously 
   developed and improved by the Founding Members and other qualified 
   Members.  The Collective establishes that such training curriculum 
   should be reviewed and approved for implementation by the Members’ 
   majority vote every 12 months.



3.7. POWERS AND DUTIES OF MEMBERS

   3.7.1. Management of Company.
   
   Management of the Collective is the most important privilege and the 
   responsibility of a Member.  Member’s direct involvement in the 
   management of the Collective, sharing in its success and 
   responsibility for making the Collective’s business profitable and 
   sustainable makes it different from any other type of company, by 
   emphasizing the Trust, Commitment and Equity of every Member in the 
   success of the company.   The Collective shall establish that:
   
     3.7.1.1. Members, within the authority granted by the Act and the 
     terms of this Agreement shall have the complete power and authority 
     to manage and operate the Collective and make all decisions 
     affecting its business and affairs through collaboration and 
     voting.
     
     3.7.1.2. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, all 
     decisions and documents relating to the management and operation 
     of the Collective shall be made and executed by a majority vote, 
     and all decisions should address the interests of all Members.
     
     3.7.1.3. Third parties dealing with the Collective shall be 
     entitled to rely conclusively upon the power and authority of the 
     decisions voted by the majority of Members in interest of all 
     Members to manage and operate the business and affairs of the 
     Collective.
     
     3.7.1.4. Members accept and abide by the decisions of the Collective 
     made by voting of all Members.  Members accept and agree that they 
     shall focus on the principles and values that benefit the whole 
     organization and not their personal or group interests.  
     
   3.7.2. Member's Decisions.
   
   Whenever in this Agreement reference is made to the decision, consent, 
   approval, judgment, or action of the Members, unless otherwise 
   expressly provided in this Agreement, such decision, consent, 
   approval, judgment, or action shall mean a Majority of the Members.
   
   3.7.3. Member’s Commitment.
   
   Upon Members’ decision specifically executed through voting (majority 
   vote or otherwise stipulated according to this Agreement or other 
   accepted rules and policies), ALL Members must commit and execute 
   the provisions of the decision, as voted. 
   
   3.7.4. Member’s Withdrawal.
   
   A Member has no power to withdraw from the Collective, except as 
   otherwise provided in this Agreement, through the termination process.
   
   3.7.5. Member’s Voting by Name.
   
   The Collective shall record and identify each Member’s vote on any 
   decision, such that the voting record is kept in perpetuity.  
   The Collective shall deploy a digital identity and voting system 
   that shall facilitate this process.



3.8. MEMBERS ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 

   3.8.1. Collective’s Flat Structure.
   
   The Collective shall establish and maintain a "flat” decentralized 
   structure.  Unlike the traditional corporate environment with 
   multiple, and sometimes hindering, levels of management (and even 
   bureaucracy), the Collective shall take all measures to keep agility 
   and flexibility to change and adapt as the main attributes of its 
   structure.  Thus, the organization will minimize the management and 
   control structures and will turn them into functions that can be 
   executed by any Member (with the appropriate training, mentoring 
   and coaching).
   
   3.8.2. Collective’s Roles.
   
   To operate in a flat organization structure, the Collective shall 
   define the four (4) key roles that any Member shall play while 
   leading the Collective, namely: the Owner of Business, the Operator 
   of Business, the People Developer and the Subject Matter Expert and 
   Continuous Learner.
   
     3.8.2.1. Role: Owner of Business.
     
     Member's main role in the Collective is to act, behave and 
     exemplify qualities of an owner, proprietor and entrepreneur 
     growing and developing his/her business for the benefit of the 
     Collective as a whole.  Ownership attributes include legal and 
     ethical practices, respect of other co-owners, partners, members, 
     clients, contractors, suppliers, workers and any other associates 
     that the Collective engages with. Owners must show to the world and 
     Clients that the Collective is the best business partner in the 
     realm of the Collectives’s core competencies and capabilities to 
     deliver value.  Owners always support and enhance such capabilities 
     s the top priority.  In short, Owner’s objective is to create the 
     Goodwill of the Collective.  If compared to the traditional 
     corporate roles, this role is akin to CEO’s setting vision and 
     direction, Sales and Marketing creating the value proposition, and 
     the Board’s strategy and goals.
     
     3.8.2.2. Role: Operator of Business.
     
     Member’s second most important role in the Collective is to act as 
     a responsible business operator, frugal but understanding the needs 
     to allocate resources that will increase and enhance the 
     capabilities of the Collective.  Business Operators must have the 
     Strategic Vision and also be able to achieve tactical goals and 
     manage day-to-day routine operations.   More successful is the 
     Collective, more benefits a Member will be able to receive 
     personally from participating in the business.  If compared to the 
     traditional corporate roles, this role is akin to Chief Operating 
     Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Security Officer and any 
     other operational and delivery role to build value for the 
     organization by delivering client’s value.
     
     3.8.2.3. Role: People Developer.
     
     Member’s third most important role in the Collective is to build 
     professional supportive relationships with other Member that 
     provide for a cohesive, creative and safe environment for all 
     Members to work in.  Members are encouraged to be continuous 
     learners, especially in the area of human interactions, so the 
     Collective is better posed to address any kinds of cultural and 
     social diversities, differences in skills and experiences of 
     Members, the complexity of new development challenges for the 
     digital economy, the pace of change in the industry and the world 
     in genera.  Members should continuously act as Mentors and Mentees, 
     helping others and receiving feedback and assistance in developing 
     their qualities that can help them advance.   In this role Members 
     will be active involved in conflict resolution, mitigation and 
     relationship building efforts. If compared to the traditional 
     corporate roles, this roles is akin to a Mentor, and not an HR or 
     the so called “Human Capital” executive.  HR is an artifact of a 
     “wage slavery” organization, and it is not applicable to the 
     cooperative movement.
     
     3.8.2.4. Role: Subject Matter Expert and Continuous Learner-Teacher.
     
     Every Member of the Collective is expected to bring and develop at 
     least one Subject Matter Expertise in a field of Member’s interest.  
     If such expertise is not available at the time of applying for a 
     Membership at the Collective, Member must clearly state and commit 
     to learning the desired specialty, as the Collective will provide 
     opportunities for learning and growth in this field.  Teaching what 
     you know best and learning from others is the fourth role that 
     every Member in the Collective should play as frequently as 
     possible. Collaboration through teams and small groups provides 
     this opportunity for mutual enrichment through concrete work on 
     assignments.

   3.8.3.  Responsibilities, Roles and Competencies.
   
   When working on any domain of responsibility within the Collective, 
   the Committee or a Team (on an Internal Program or Revenue generating 
   Program for Clients), a Member acts within one or all Roles, as set 
   in this Agreement.  However, to achieve the set goals, ones need to 
   have a certain level of competency in tasks and activities that must 
   be performed.  Some skill sets take years to develop and master.  
   The Collective shall build tools and methods to facilitate 
   outcome-focused collaboration of Members with various level of 
   competency working in small (three or more Members) teams on any task 
   or activity within the domain of responsibility.  These teams shall 
   have one Lead and two (or more) Support Members who jointly reach the 
   set goals.  The Lead and Support positions shall constantly rotate, 
   giving the Members the opportunity to lead, to learn, to mentor and 
   to practice.   The Collective shall consider a Competency an attribute 
   of a individual Member, and multiple competencies of several Members 
   allow to achieve the Capability that is needed to perform activities 
   within every Responsibility Domain, and the quality of outcomes is 
   guaranteed by Members acting in their the Roles.
   
   3.8.4. Competency Requirements.
   
   The Collective shall accept Members who either have a professional 
   competency in any field of Digital Knowledge-based work, or are 
   aspiring to learn such skills through practical work and participation.  
   In other words, the Collective’s only requirement for Competency is 
   the desire to work in the Digital Industry (which has a very wide 
   definition).
   
   3.8.5. Growth Potential.
   
   While workers in traditional companies follow the career paths that 
   can be categorized as upward or downward direction related to their 
   position in the company, and usually only within a limited domain, 
   a Member in the Collective retains his/her (central) position in the 
   organization and is able to act in each one of these Roles on 
   different Programs or engagements.  Since there is no traditional 
   “upward career path” at the Collective, Member’s growth is 
   accomplished by achieving mastery in any or all roles and becoming a 
   Mentor and a Master helping other Members to achieve the same.  
   The Collective shall encourage Members to build solid in-depth skills 
   in 1-2 specific subjects, expand specialization to 2-4 more related 
   categories and then gain understanding of wider knowledge domains, 
   enabling cross-skill and polymath capabilities.  The Collective shall 
   allow the Members to create individual Growth & Development plans for 
   acquiring new skills and learning responsibilities to manage the 
   business of the Collective. Unlike the traditional corporate growth 
   paths (junior to associate to senior to manager to senior manager to 
   director and so on), the Collective’s growth plan shall be based on 
   achieving mastery in Member's core competency (I-model), then 
   expanding generalization skills (T-model), and then to mastery in 
   several knowledge areas (E-model).
   
   3.8.6. Advantages of Flat Structures.
   
   Development of modern digital applications and systems requires 
   extreme agility and flexibility to align and allocate resources for 
   rapid, lean and cost-effective execution of any program.  
   The Collective’s Flat Org Structure based on Responsibilities, Roles 
   and Competencies allows for creating and deploying agile teams that 
   can execute under these new pressing requirements.  Unlike the 
   traditional (HR-sourced) teams with some star performers (depending 
   on how much HR was allowed to pay in salaries), the Collective 
   enables the most competent Members not only lead, mentor and direct 
   their assignments, but also transfer knowledge and enable less 
   experienced Members to gain the needed skills, preparing them to 
   branch off to new teams and lead new engagements.  And this is the 
   natural growth that the Collective shall be nurturing and facilitating, 
   as new engagements lead to more revenues and more payout for all.  
   Moreover, the continuous loop of self-management and mutual support 
   eliminates the inter-team dependencies and leads to sustainable and 
   consistent execution and delivery of value towards the set goals by 
   the Collective’s teams, even if some Members need to take time off 
   for personal reasons.
   
   3.8.7. Domains of Responsibility.
   
   The Collective shall divide, by the decision of the Members, the 
   responsibilities for managing the Collective among different 
   Committees or Teams.  The following responsibilities are the most 
   common, and additional can be established, as needed:

    • Business Strategy, Sales, Revenues
    • Infrastructure and systems
    • Application development (internal and external)
    • Finance and Administration
    • Sales, Marketing, Communications
    • Members management and well-being

   3.8.8. Management through Committees.
   
   The Collective shall establish efficient ways to operate business, 
   one of which is delegation of authority to an elected group of 
   Members to manage a specific responsibility.  The Collective shall 
   divide the responsibilities to be managed through the elected 
   Committees.  In additional to general voting, a Member shall have 
   the opportunity to run the business through the Committees.   
   The Committees shall operate with certain autonomy in implementing 
   policies voted by the Members.  The Committees shall provide 
   accountability and reporting to Members on quarterly and annual 
   basis.  A complete list of all established Committees, their 
   functions and elected Members will be kept in a different document, 
   "Policies, Procedures, Rules, and Bylaws” to be created to supplement 
   this Agreement. The Committees will keep transparent and accessible 
   to Members logs and records of their activities.

   3.8.9. Functions Not Transferable to Committees. 
   The following decisions require unanimous consent by 100% Members’ 
   vote and cannot be delegated to Committees:

    • Modifications and amendments to this Operating Agreement
    • Adding and accepting new Workers-Members into the Collective
    • Capital Account allocations amounts
    • Membership annual fees
    • Expenses and/or loans of more than $5,000
    • Programs creation and budget allocation
    • Approving the Collective's merger, sale, or dissolution
    • Approval of Patronage Dividend distribution, the percent and 
      amount thereof

   For Committees, the Proposals are created and voted by the 
   Committee's members.  The entire voting workflow and process is the 
   same, but the constraint is on the Members who were elected into the 
   Committee and are eligible to vote on the Committee’s issues. 



3.10. DELEGATED DECISION POWER TO COMMITTEES

   3.10.1. Delegated Powers.
   
   The Collective allows Members to delegate their decision-making power 
   to Committees established to streamline operations and execution of 
   programs in the Collective.  Members elect all Committee members 
   for 1 year.  Every Committee has the power to decide on the matters 
   of their established responsibility.  If a Committee is created to 
   oversee and execute a specific Program approved by the Collective 
   with a specific approved budget, the Committee members can make 
   financial decisions within the established budget and spending 
   guidelines.  



3.11. TRANSFER OF MEMBERSHIP INTEREST

       otherwise at the expense of the Collective or other fellow 
       Members), given that the Member is provided the opportunity to 
       explain his/her motives for such actions.
       
       3.12.3.1.3. After conducting the Collective’s business in 
       unfair and unethical ways (even if the Collective has not been 
       legally incriminated of any wrongdoing) which can cause damage 
       to the reputation and the Goodwill of the Collective.
       
       3.12.3.1.4. After an act of violence or aggression (either 
       physical or verbal), including any act of harassment (physical, 
       sexual or emotional ), against any other Member, or a client or

       business, at the location of the Collective’s business or if 
       such aggression and/or call to violence is conducted via 
       electronic means (aka "on-line bullying") for which the Member 
       may or may not be found guilty in the court of law later on. 
       Violence, call for violence and any form of harassment shall 
       not be tolerated, and the Member is the subject to immediate 
       investigation and termination, if confirmed by the preponderance 
       of evidence. 
       
       3.12.3.1.5. After exhibiting behavior and conducting acts of 
       racial and ethnic intolerance and disrespect towards any racial, 
       ethnic or national group. Stirring any ethnic or nationalistic 
       conflict based on superiority of any race, country or region is 
       not tolerated. The Collective recognizes and respects any 
       patriotic feelings of any national to his/her country as long 
       as expression of such feelings does not come in conflict with 
       members of other nations, origins and regions. 
       
       3.12.3.1.6. After exhibiting behavior and conducting acts of 
       intolerance and disrespect to any religion or creed. 
       The Collective recognizes and respects any religion that its 
       Members choose to believe in. The Collective recognizes that 
       it may be important for a Member to speak about his/her 
       religion because its the foundation of his/her core values and 
       beliefs. The Collective recognizes that a Member may speak 
       about such matters if the Member directs the focus of his/her 
       statements towards self (like "how my religion or beliefs 
       helps me", "how I feel about my religion/beliefs") and avoids 
       any proselytizing, accusations of or comparisons to other 
       religions, either in directly offensive or hidden ways to show 
       his/her religion's superiority. In this regard, atheism is 
       considered a form of a religion "of non-belief" and will be 
       treated as stated above. The Collective reserves the right to 
       consider termination of any Members involved in religious 
       debates during the Collective’s business and using the 
       Collective’s platform, means of communications and facilities. 
       Members interested in engaging in the above described religious

       religious or belief affiliations.
       
       3.12.3.1.7. After conducting activities in support of a 
       political party, a candidate, a ballot proposition (either in 
       Federal, State or Local elections) conducted during the 
       Collective’s business hours, using the Collective’s resources, 
       platform, means of communication, logos or any marketing 
       materials, unless the Collective, through its Members general 
       vote, has approved such specific position / stance on a 
       political issue that pertains to the livelihood of the 
       Collective’s business and operations. The Collective recognizes 
       that Members have the right to express their personal opinion 
       on any political matter they want, as long as such expression 
       does not turn into a campaign or political action at the 
       Collective's or its clients' workplace. Members agree to 
       disagree on any political matter, and further agree to leave 
       such matters outside the Collective’s physical and electronic 
       boundaries.  The Collective encourages its members to be active 
       citizens and participate in the political process of their 
       state or country as private individuals and not as Co-Owners in 
       the Collective’s business.

     If the above stated reasons are not applicable to consider a 
     Member termination, the following conditions shall provide 
     grounds for termination:
         
       3.12.3.2.1. Work performance and compliance with this Agreement 
       and other Collective’s procedures and rules defined in the 
       Collective's respective documents, adapted and voted in by all 
       Members, will be applied to every Member. Repeated 
       non-compliance and sub-standard performance, especially as it 
       relates to the established product quality, behavior, meeting 
       obligations and lack of improvement in the key areas of 
       performance over a period of time, will constitute grounds for 
       termination.
       
       3.12.3.2.2. Failure to use the opportunities to correct the 
       perceived problem in performance, behavior, attitude or 
       relations with other Member and clients provided though 
       extended period of evaluation, mentoring and support from other 
       Members.
       
     3.12.3.3. Tenure and Termination for Other Reasons.
     
       3.12.3.3.1. A Member can be terminated by a vote of 75% of all 
       Members, if the person (or entity) has been a Member for less 
       than 6 months. 
       
       3.12.3.3.2. A Member who has been a Member for over 6 months 
       can be terminated through a special arbitration elected by all 
       Members to conduct an impartial review and make a decision in 
       the Collective's best interest. A Member agrees not to pursue 
       legal action against any arbitrator, if he/she does not like 
       the decision. 
     
     3.12.3.4. Arbitration.
     
     The Termination through Arbitration is defined as the following 
     process:
       
       3.12.3.4.1. The majority of Members must vote to initiate the 
       arbitration and elect five (5) Arbitrators. 
       
       3.12.3.4.2. The Arbitrators will hear statements of every 
       interested Member.
       
       3.12.3.4.3. Each Arbitrator decides if the Collective will be 
       harmed by the Member’s continuous membership in the 
       organization. Each Arbitrator will cast one vote in favor or 
       against termination. 
       
       3.12.3.4.4. If Arbitrators unanimously vote to terminate, the 
       Member is terminated. 
       
       3.12.3.5. Right to Reinstatement.
       
       A Member terminated from the Collective though arbitration by 
       the unanimous vote of five (5) Arbitrators has a right to request 
       the Collective to consider this request for Reinstatement.  
       The Collective shall approve such request by the vote of 75% of 
       Members.  After the Member presents his/her request, the 
       Collective shall vote to reinstate the Member, and the 75% of 
       Members vote is required to pass.  
   
   3.12.4. Termination by Death or Incompetence.
   
   Upon Member’s Death or legally adjudicated incompetence, of which 
   the Designated Beneficiary of the Member should notify the Collective 
   within 180 days of such event, the Collective shall consider the 
   Member “voluntarily resigned” with all benefits of voluntary 
   termination awarded by this Agreement.  



3.13. MITIGATING MEMBER RELATIONS

   3.13.1. Members Commitment.
   
   The Collective is built on the principles of transparency, trust, 
   commitment to the common cause of building value for all its members, 
   commitment to each other, and commitment to clients.  All Members 
   agree that achieving fairness and equity in the value created from 
   labor and contributions from all Members is the top objective of the 
   organization, as all are equal in voting rights and the opportunity 
   o manage the organization, as it is also the responsibility of every 
   Member. All Members explicitly agree to operate without discrimination 
   on any basis (social, racial, national, personal sexual or other), 
   with the respect and mutual cooperation among All Members. 
   
   3.13.2. Members' Motto.
   
   A Success of One is a Success of All.  The Collective provides a 
   unique opportunity for every Member to realize its professional 
   potential and be as successful as he/she wants to be.  That 
   obligates every Member to work for the success of the entire 
   Collective. 
   
   3.13.3. Members Shall Protect the Collective.
   
   The Collective is different from the HR-operated corporations.  
   The Collective shall strive to be a wholesome organization in which 
   Members find the purpose in life and the opportunity to advance to 
   the levels which only they can imagine and set for themselves.  
   The Collective is not an HR-managed corporation, where the goal of 
   Human Resources function is to protect the corporation from any 
   liability that may arise from employing a hired wage labor.  
   The Collective is the extension of its Members professional goals 
   and aspirations implemented in the platform and systems to enable 
   fair compensation for Member’s labor.  Any conflict that a Member may 
   have with another Member or the Collective itself, will affect the 
   Member, as efforts and attention will be given to resolving the 
   conflict, but not productive and gainful work on the Collective’s 
   and Member’s personal goals.
   
   3.13.4. Conflicts are Natural and Anticipated.
   
   Members recognize that an inter-personal conflict is "human" and not 
   avoidable. They recognize that if and when tensions and resentments 
   arise, sooner they are addressed, easier it would be to repair 
   relationships and create opportunities for even more effective 
   collaborations. If a Member feels disappointed, hurt, confused, 
   offended, or angry because of the words or actions of another Member, 
   the Member shall do one of the following:
   
     3.13.4.1. Try to understand the other person's point of view, 
     forgive, and/or move on, or
     
     3.13.4.2. Try to resolve the matter through discussion with 
     the Member
     3.13.4.3. Seek a mentor's help and mediation assistance

   3.13.5. Mentoring and Mediation.
   
   Members commit themselves to resolving conflicts in a quick and 
   peaceful manner, first through cordial conversation, and if the issue 
   is not resolved, then through mediation with a Founding Member or a 
   Member with mentoring skills and experience. For matters of personal 
   conflict (including soft-skills, work ethics, attitudes, etc.) any 
   Member with mentoring and conflict resolution skills can be asked to 
   mediate and mentor. For conflicts arising on the basis of professional 
   opinions and disagreements on "subject matter" issues that may be 
   based on specific skills, experience, knowledge and understanding of 
   problems or possible solutions, conflicting Members should seek 
   mentoring from Members with at least the peer level or above 
   experience who are not working on the same program or domain. 
   In other words, conflicts on the professional matters should be 
   addressed through mediation with independent Members impartial to 
   the engagement or work of the conflicting Members. 

   3.13.6. Improvement.
   
   All Members agree that throughout their career at the Collective, 
   they will be both: a mentor and a mentee, potentially at the same 
   time, but on different matters.  Members agree and understand that 
   mentoring and mediation is the fastest and most effective way to 
   achieve consensus among people bound by the same goals and objectives.  
   This approach is the only viable solution to achieve improvement 
   in the Collective’s operations to benefit all.
   
   3.13.7. Three mediation attempts.
   
   Every deep-rooted and difficult conflict should conduct at least 
   three (3) mediation attempts with different mentors and mediators by 
   other Members.  The Collective requires this as a mandatory provision, 
   before any matter can be brought by a Member to a court of law.  



3.14. MEMBERS WORK WEEK

   3.14.1. Minimal Work Week.
   
   The Collective recognizes that Members may work different number of 
   hours per week/month. When the Collective reaches the Maturity and 
   Operations Phase, as stated in this Agreement, Members shall commit 
   at least 32 hours/week, whether the work will be for an external 
   client (revenue stream) or internal programs ("at risk" work). 
   During the Bootstrap Phase, the Collective shall allow low number of 
   hours: 20 hours/week.  All work must be done according to the approved 
   in advanced program and estimated effort to complete the tasks. 
   
   3.14.2. No guarantees of Work Hours or Overtime.
   
   The Collective shall not guarantee that all Members will work the 
   same amount of time. The Collective shall not provide Overtime Hours, 
   since all Members work a the rate that they established for 
   themselves and are paid in DFMV for every hour worked.  The Collective 
   shall allow Members to work on the Internal Non-Revenue generation 
   Programs to any extend that Members find possible, so that it does 
   not interfere with their other work on the Revenue-generation Programs.  
   Members earn their contributions for “Pie Slices” calculation of 
   their share in the value of Patronage Distributions every time they 
   work on the approved Internal Programs which have no immediate cash 
   compensation for their DFMV.



SECTION 4: OPERATIONAL PHASES / LIFE CYCLE

4.1. BOOTSTRAP PHASE

   4.1.1. Bootstrap Definition.
   
   The Collective is a cooperative enterprise by Workers-Owners who 
   collaborate and put their efforts to create a successful business 
   enterprise in Digital Knowledge-based economy. Although the market 
   entry point is significantly lower than in other industries that 
   require considerable amount of capital to start operations and to 
   generate revenue, the Collective must still undergo a period of 
   forming, organizing and bootstrapping to create core systems, 
   structures and revenue channels. At this period, the Collective will 
   be operating based on the principles expressed in the Vision Document 
   and the provisions of this Agreement with reliance on Workers-Members 
   contribution of effort (labor) and cash (through Members' Capital 
   Accounts).
   
   4.1.2. Completing the Bootstrap Phase.
   
   The Collective will be managed by Founding Members and the core 
   early-adopters members operating at cost. Once the revenues exceed 
   the costs and the net income is generated (after all costs, taxes 
   and debts), the Bootstrap Period will be considered over, and the 
   necessary adjustments will be required to the Operating Agreement 
   and other documents regulating the Collective to be voted and 
   approved by all active current Members at that time.



4.2. GROWTH  PHASE 

   4.2.1. Revenues as Condition for Growth.
   
   Transition to the Growth Phase from the Bootstrap Phase will be 
   evident when the Collective will be able to cover all operational 
   costs and to start generating revenues for its Members, regardless 
   if they work on internal or external programs.  
   
   4.2.2. Growth Objectives.
   
   The Growth Phase will be characterized by creation of new Revenue 
   Streams and opportunities for Members to engage in new programs and 
   services.  Membership will be growing proportional to the new 
   revenue opportunities.  New teams will be forming to execute new 
   Programs which the Collective will be establishing as the 
   opportunities develop into leads and subsequent contracts and 
   revenue streams. 
   
   4.2.3. Capabilities.
   
   During the Growth Phase, the Collective’s systems, infrastructure and 
   operations will be transformed into a scalable and reliable model to 
   sustain such growth, decentralization of control of various teams and 
   programs and ability to generate new supporting structures based on 
   demand and with scale.
   
   
   
4.3. MATURITY AND OPERATIONS PHASE

   4.3.1. Maturity Characteristics.
   The Collective will transition to the Maturity and Operations Phase, 
   when most of Members are working on external programs and services or 
   internal product development programs, which are sufficiently funded 
   by the Collective, so all Members engaged are able to receive their 
   DFMV compensation on a regular basis.
   
   4.3.2. Wide Automation.
   
   The management burden is simplified when the Collective has entered 
   the Maturity and Operations Phase, as most of the inner processes are 
   automated and the continuous delivery platform provides to creating 
   new capabilities for teams to organize, pursue business and engage 
   with external clients.
   
   4.3.3. Continuous Investment in Growth.
   
   The Maturity and Operations Phase will be categorized by the maximized r
   evenues to the Members.  This is the stable phase of the Collective’s 
   life cycle, but the Members agree that in order to support 
   sustainability and reliable operations, the growth and innovation, 
   through new products and services, are required, and Members agree to 
   provide funds and effort to continue such growth.
   
   4.3.4. The Collective's Day to Day Activities
   
     4.3.4.1. The Collective's Day to Day Activities will be defined in 
     the separate "Procedures, Policies, Rules and Bylaws" document.  
     The core principles that govern daily activities are based on Agile 
     principles that prescribe how programs should be executed. Namely, 
     these include:

                       is required for the Collective’s business.  
                       The Collective shall develop the system for 
                       Self-Soverign Identity where a Member is in

      in the Rules document. 



4.4. WINDING DOWN PHASE

   4.4.1. Continuous, Sustainable Work Environment.
   
   The Collective shall provide the process and procedures through which 
   it can wind down its operations and terminate, if necessary.   
   However, it is not the intent of this Collective to be terminated or 
   dissolved, even through a lucrative sale, because the idea of a 
   cooperative company to create a long-lasting and sustainable work 
   opportunities for Members. 
   
   4.4.2. Dissolution. 
   
   Dissolution of the Collective means that the Collective will cease 
   to conduct business and terminate this Agreement between the Members.  
   The Collective will be dissolved on the happening of any of the 
   following events:
   
     4.4.2.1. The unanimous agreement of all of the Members for a sale 
              to another collective, cooperative, corporation or company;
              
     4.4.2.2. The actual sale of the Collective’s business and properties, 
              including Intellectual Property, for which the agreed upon 
              amount in cash is paid to the Members;
              
     4.4.2.3. By operation of law which results in a mandated 
              dissolution of the Collective through sale or termination 
              of operations.
   
   4.4.3. Winding Up.
   
   On the dissolution of the Collective, the Members must take full 
   account of the Collective's assets and liabilities, and the assets 
   will be liquidated as promptly as is consistent with obtaining their 
   fair value, and the proceeds, to the extent sufficient to pay the 
   Collective's obligations with respect to the liquidation, will be 
   applied and distributed, after any gain or loss realized in connection
   with the liquidation has been allocated in accordance with this 
   Agreement, and the Members' Capital Accounts have been adjusted to 
   reflect the allocation and all other transactions through the date of 
   the distribution, in the following order:
   
     4.4.3.1. Payment of all liquidation costs and expenses, including the 
              liquidators’ fees.
              
     4.4.3.2. Payment and discharge of all the Collective's debts and 
              liabilities to persons or organizations other than Members 
              (debts to Non-Members).
              
     4.4.3.3. Payment and discharge of any Collective’s debts and 
              liabilities owed to Members, including any guaranteed 
              payments.
              
     4.4.3.4. Payment to Members in the amount of their respective 
              adjusted Capital Account balances on the date of 
              distribution; provided, however, that Members have no 
              outstanding debts to the Collective.  Such Member debts 
              can be: unpaid required Capital Account contributions, 
              unpaid membership fees and direct outstanding loans taken 
              by a Member from the Collective.  The debts will be 
              deducted from the Member’s Capital Account, and the 
              remainder will be paid out as distribution. The proceeds 
              from the sale of the Collective are not included in this 
              distribution.
              
     4.4.3.5. Payment of the remaining money and assets from the 
              Unallocated Capital Account, which at the time of the 
              dissolution equals or exceeds $100,000, to all present and 
              past Members (of the last 30 years) in proportion to the 
              number of “Pie Slices” that each Member has accumulated 
              over his/her life time being a Member of the Collective.  
              If the Unallocated Capital Account at the time of the 
              dissolution is less than $100,000, then it will be paid 
              only to the present active Members in the proportion to 
              the number of “Pie Slices” that present active Members 
              have accumulated over the period of their membership in 
              the Collective. 
              
              4.4.3.5.1. This provision of the Agreement cannot be 
                         changed without the consent of at least 51% of 
                         all previous, living Members (who have retired 
                         or voluntarily terminated their membership).

   4.4.4. Dissolution of Unallocated Capital Account holding Surplus.  
   
   All general Collective’s funds and accounts holding the revenues from 
   the Surplus earned by Members only, either held in the Unallocated 
   Capital Account or any other Collective’s account created for the 
   Collective’s business,  other than the Members’ individual Capital 
   Accounts, will be divided between all active current Members and past 
   Members (retired or terminated without cause from the Collective) 
   based on the total amount of “Slices” earned by each Member through 
   the his/her tenure with the collective.  The Collective shall ensure, 
   this way, that any member, who put in any effort in serving the 
   Collective and building its value, will be rewarded, even if that 
   person is not an active member at the time of dissolution.  
   
   4.4.5. Dissolution of the Indivisible Reserves holding Profits. 
   
   Distribution of the reserves holding Non-Member earned profits to 
   Members is not allowed.  Upon dissolution of the Collective, all 
   Indivisible Reserves should be paid to the Collective’s beneficiary, 
   such as a cooperative development company or a non-profit organization 
   supporting cooperative movement.  This provision also follows the 
   Sub-chapter T requirements, namely that the earnings are distributed 
   on the basis of patronage.  
   
   4.4.6. Payment to the Beneficiaries of Diseased Members.  
   
   The payment that would go to a past Member who has passed away would 
   go the Member’s Designated Beneficiary, whose name appears in the 
   Statement of Information of that Member.  If a Member has passed away 
   before the distribution and has not named a Designated Beneficiary, 
   or if the Collective cannot find the past Member or his/her Designated 
   Beneficiary after reasonable effort, the Collective will not be 
   obliged to distribute to that Member, their Designated Beneficiary, 
   or any other heir or beneficiary of that past Member.  It is the past 
   Member’s obligation to inform the Collective of his/her current 
   contact information and the name and contact information for the 
   Designated Beneficiary.  



SECTION 5: FINANCIAL AND ACCOUNTING

5.1. SOLVING COOPERATIVE STARTUP PROBLEM

   5.1.1. Profits and Losses in a Traditional Co-op Startups.
   
   In a traditional, non-digital Cooperative Startup, where the Founders 
   have to come up with a significant amount of capital (to acquire 
   tools, machinery, etc.), there is always a risk that the Founders 
   will not be able to receive compensation for their investments in the 
   present from the revenues that the cooperative may receive in the 
   future.  Profits that the future members of the cooperative may 
   receive will not extend to the current members or Founders who have 
   to bootstrap the cooperative which is losing money.  Moreover, until 
   a cooperative can generate a revenue, it cannot payout patronage 
   distributions to Founders and members even if they contribute labor.  
   
   5.1.2. “Pie Slices” Model Solution.
   
   The Collective’s “Pie Slices” model eliminates that problem because 
   contributions of all Members are recorded in fictional units that 
   will be used to establish each Member’s value of contributions vs. 
   the total “Pie” of contributions from all Members at the time when 
   the revenues are received and distributions can be made.  Even 
   Members who leave the Collective voluntarily will be entitled to 
   receive their share from the sale of the Collective.
   
   5.1.3. Every Contribution Matters.
   
   Contributions of time/effort and cash for any “at risk” activity is 
   accounted for and will be used in the future calculation of Member’s
   share.
   
   5.1.4. Members are lose Partners.
   
   This Collective is for and by Digital Knowledge workers, who can 
   work in teams and collectively produce value, however the skills 
   and experience of each Member is unique, and so is the nature of 
   their Fair Market Value. The revenue of the Collective depends on the 
   revenue potential of each Member. Collectively, Members contribute 
   the Surplus from their FMV to the Collective (and can be eligible 
   for future distributions from it), but the Discounted Fair Market 
   Value is theirs to keep.   In this sense, Members are “lose Partners” 
   because some Members can start working on client engagements and 
   generate their DFMV right away.   Other Members, who work on the 
   internal Non-Revenue generation Programs, will not have this ability. 
   There is no equality and guarantee that all Members will be 
   compensated or compensated equally.
   
   5.1.5. Shortest Path to Revenue Generation.
   
   The shortest path to generating revenue for the Collective is to 
   have all Members working on Client programs from day one.  This is 
   the desirable state, but internal Collective development must be 
   done, and that will require Members’ investment to be compensated 
   later.  The Collective estimates that 4:1 ratio of external 
   (Client-paid) to internal (Non-revenue generation) programs is the 
   fastest path to revenues and ability to compensate Members working 
   on internal programs.  In other words, out of 5 Members with the 
   same FMV, 4 Members working on Client programs, for which they are 
   immediately paid, will be able to sustain 1 Member working on 
   internal programs. 



5.2. ACCOUNTING METHOD, TOOLS

   5.2.1. Method of Accounting.
   
   The Collective will use the CASH METHOD of accounting determined by 
   the Members for financial reporting and tax purposes.
   
   5.2.2. Advantage of Cash Accounting.
   
   For a Digital Knowledge Workers Collective, the Cash Accounting is 
   the appropriate method, because the Collective provides 
   knowledge-based services (consulting), and being a Cloud-native, 
   enterprise, uses operational costs (not capital investments) to 
   purchase all necessary tools (like the Cloud infrastructure), hence 
   paying monthly recurrent costs.  For each accounting period, it’s 
   very simple to calculate all costs and all cash receipts.  After 
   allocations to the Reserve Fund, the remaining balance is the Surplus 
   that can be eligible to Patronage Distributions.
   
   5.2.3. Accounting Implementation.
   
   The Collective shall appoint the qualified Members to the accounting 
   function and use external tools to reduce in-house overhead of 
   Accounting.
   
     5.2.3.1. Members shall appoint a Member with appropriate 
     qualifications in accounting and finance to server as a Director 
     of Finance for the Collective, alternatively the Collective shall 
     hire a certified public accounting firm to handle this function, 
     until the Collective has enough Members with such competencies to 
     handle the financial function internally.  Members shall establish 
     Committees for financial management: Finance, Budget, Audit and 
     others, as necessary, and encourage Members with the related 
     competencies to take over this function from the external partner.
     
     5.2.3.2. Members will designate a cloud-based Software As A Service 
     solution for managing the Collective’s General Ledger, Books and 
     Accounts.
     
   5.2.4. Simplified Accounting for Collective’s Specifics.
   
   The Collective shall seek a simple but secure and transparent system 
   of accounting and managing the books, so that the needs and specifics 
   of the Collective are addressed.  The Collective’s tax objective is 
   to minimize tax burden in the short term, thus favoring Operational 
   Expenses (OPEX), which allows cost deductions in the tax period when 
   cost occurred, vs Capital Expenses (CAPEX), which complicate 
   accounting.  The Collective shall establish the following guidelines 
   for software development accounting:
   
     5.2.4.1. Costs are OPEX when the work is related to planning, 
     evaluation, prototyping, testing, and other work that can be stopped 
     without creating an asset (internal or for future sale to 3rd 
     parties).
     
     5.2.4.2. Costs are CAPEX when application development or application 
     configuration (or integration) work is performed, such that a 
     software asset is created (a program, a platform, a system, etc.).
     
     5.2.4.3. Costs are OPEX during post-implementation or production 
     phase, as they are day-to-day running costs. 
   
   5.2.5. Accounting per Type of Work.
   
   The main aspects of the Collective’s accounting for each type of 
   work are:
     
     5.2.5.1. Revenue generation Programs (Client Custom Work). 
     
     For Revenue generating programs (custom solution development for 
     Client, aka “Consulting”), the revenues are recorded when the p
     ayment is received for services rendered, and there is evidence of 
     a Managed Investment Agreement (or any other agreement for a 
     Member’s work on the Client’s engagement) and the record of value 
     delivered (completed objectives).
     
        5.2.5.1.1. “Cost of Services” for the Consulting Services should 
        be passed to Members who personally incur the costs when 
        generating the revenue which will be “passed through” to them in t
        he form of the Patronage Distributions,” so that Members’ business 
        expenses should be subject of tax deductions on individual Members’ 
        tax returns, unless such “Cost of Services” can be allocated to 
        the entire Team working on the Client engagement.  In the latter 
        case, the costs will be allocated directly from the Collective 
        before calculating the Gross Income from the Program (Client 
        engagement).
        
        5.2.5.1.2. “Operating Expenses” are different from the “Cost of 
        Services” that will be passed through to Members.  Operating 
        Expenses would cover all aspects of the Collective’s work to 
        enable Client engagements and team/member assignments to the 
        Revenue generation programs.  Operating Expenses are to be paid 
        from the Gross Income from the programs that generate revenues.  
        After Operating Expenses are paid, the remainder is the Surplus 
        of the Collective (aka “Net Income”).  If the Operating Expenses 
        exceed the Gross Income, then the Collective will record a Loss.   
     
     5.2.5.2. Internal Programs.
     
     For the Internal Programs that manage software development for the 
     Collective’s own needs and operations, there are three phases that 
     are the focus of the general accounting practices:
     
       1) Preliminary project phase (planning, conceptual design, 
       alternatives evaluations)
       
       2) Application development (design, architecture, coding)
       
       3) Post-implementation (usability testing, release, maintenance)
     
     Costs of the Application development phase shall be capitalized and 
     recorded as an  “Asset” for the Collective.  The total value of the 
     Asset will be the sum of all DFMV rates for all Members working on 
     the program multiplied by the total number of hours, plus any 
     additional allocations for 3rd party software, cloud services, and 
     any other costs necessary to create the Internal systems and platforms.  
     
       5.2.4.2.1. All applications and software in Internal Programs are 
       created in Lean-Agile way, which means that the concept of 
       “Technological Feasibility” (described in the next section) should 
       be applied in order to establish when capitalization can start. 
       Such feasibility may not be evident until a number of Programs 
       Increments (iterations) have been completed.  For this reason, 
       the Collective shall establish that ALL application development 
       work should be capitalized when an Internal Application and/or 
       System has been conceptually completed and Program Increments 
       Planning has been done.  
     
     5.2.5.3. Products or “Software to be sold to 3rd Parties.” 
     
     Accounting guidelines for “software to be sold” consider the 
     concept of “Technological Feasibility” as a period of software 
     development, after planning, designing, coding, testing and other 
     normal phases of development, but before the moment when the 
     software is ready for general release.  Costs during Technological 
     Feasibility are usually capitalized (recorded as assets), however 
     establishing this Technological Feasibility is quite difficult, 
     especially when the Collective is operating in a Lean-Agile way 
     of software development, which means that the solutions are 
     constantly evaluated for feasibility, and a pivot from the 
     original solution is expected and anticipated, as a normal 
     occurrence in the process. Moreover, a feasibility of a product 
     may not be evident until a number of Program Increments 
     (iterations) are achieved. For this reason, the Collective shall 
     expense all costs during Product (software to be sold) development 
     (no capitalization). 



5.3. FISCAL YEAR, BANKING

   5.3.1. Fiscal Year; Taxable Year.
   
   The fiscal year and the taxable year of the Collective starts on 
   April 1 and ends on March 31.
   
   5.3.2. Capital Accounts.
   
   The Collective shall establishes itself as a Capital Account 
   Cooperative.  The Collective will maintain a Capital Account for
   each Member on a cumulative basis in accordance with federal income 
   tax accounting principles.
   
   5.3.3. Unallocated Captal Account.
   
   The Collective shall establish an “Unallocated Capital Account” – 
   UCA - (as opposed to the allocated capital accounts for each Member 
   established at the acceptance to the Collective).  UCA is the 
   account for the entire Collective.
   
   5.3.4. Banking during Bootstrapping Phase.
   
   All funds of the Collective will be deposited in a separate bank 
   account or in an account or accounts of a Savings and Loans 
   association in the name of the Collective as determined by a 
   Majority of the Members. Collective funds will be invested or 
   deposited with an institution, the accounts or deposits of which 
   are insured or guaranteed by an agency of the United States government.
   
   5.3.5. Decentralized Banking in Maturity Phase.
   
   The Collective, in accordance with its objectives to serve as a 
   decentralized organization, shall work to establish the decentralized 
   banking system, which would allow each Member to control its own 
   Capital Account, contributions and distributions from such account, 
   and allocations to the Collective’s program, as established by this 
   Agreement and other document.  Reaching Decentralized Banking 
   capabilities will be dependent on the overall maturity of the 
   Collective and resolving technology issues to enable such system.



5.4. TAXATION
   
   5.4.1. Sub-Chapter T.
   
   The Collective, organized as a Worker Cooperative and structured as 
   a Limited Liability Company, shall request to be recognized by IRS 
   as an entity subject of Sub-Chapter T taxation provisions.  The 
   advantage of the Sub-Chapter T is the flexibility to determine who 
   pays the tax (the Collective or the Members, as the recipients of 
   the Patronage Dividends) and a potential of deferral of taxes.  
   
   5.4.2. Sub-Chapter T and Members.
   
   To qualify for Sub-Chapter T of the IRS code, this Collective is 
   operating on a collective basis, such that the the Collective is an 
   extension of the patrons (Members) who own the cooperative.  
   Sub-Chapter T allows the Collective, in addition to making deductions 
   for expenses allowed by other businesses, to also deduct certain 
   distributions of net income made to the members.  Those distributions 
   become taxable income to the Member.  Consequently the net income is 
   only taxed once.  In some cases the taxation is immediately passed 
   on to the Member and in some cases the income is taxed at the 
   Collective’s level, and then the Collective receives a tax deduction, 
   and the Member accepts the taxation for that income in a future period 
   of time.  
   
   5.4.3. Sub-Chapter T and Non-Members.
   
   Profits from Non-Members’ earnings cannot be distributed as patronage 
   under the general provisions of the Sub-Chapter T.  The Collective will 
   pay taxes on Non-Member earnings and any undistributed Member Surplus 
   at the general corporate rate. 
   
   5.4.4. Sub-chapter T and Patronage Refunds.
   
   Sub-Chapter T allows the Collective to exclude patronage refunds and 
   per-unit retains from their taxable income.  Patronage refunds are 
   profit distributions made to the Member on the basis of business 
   volume and Member’s share of “Slices” in the Collective’s “Pie”.  
   The business volume can be calculated on the basis of quantity or 
   value and can be separated by product or department or Program or 
   pooled.  The IRS used the term “Patronage Dividend,” but the  term 
   “Patronage Refund” or the term “Patronage Distribution” is preferred 
   to avoid confusion with a dividend made on the basis of stock ownership.  
   Patronage Refunds can be in the form of cash or equity.  When 
   patronage is distributed in the form of equity it is typically called 
   a “Retained Patronage Distribution,” and it will be deposited into 
   the Member’s Capital Account. 
   
   5.4.5. Qualified vs. Non-Qualified Patronage Distributions.
   
   The term “qualified” refers to whether the patronage distribution is 
   tax deductible to the Collective in the current year. Cash patronage 
   refunds are always qualified. Cash patronage is therefore tax 
   deductible to the Collective and taxable income to the Member in the 
   year it is distributed. Retained Patronage Refunds/Distributions 
   (stock patronage refunds) can be either qualified or non-qualified. 
   A qualified stock patronage refund is taxable to the Collective and 
   tax deductible to the Member in the year it is distributed. 
   A non-qualified stock patronage refund is tax deductible to the 
   Collective and tax deductible to the Member in the year it is redeemed. 
   When issuing non-qualified retained patronage the Collective pays tax 
   on that income in the year of distribution and then gets a tax 
   eduction in a later year when the equity is redeemed. The taxation is 
   ultimately transfer to the Member but the timing is shifted to match 
   the cash payment rather than the stock distribution.
   
   5.4.6. Tax on Income in Reserve Fund. 
   
   Unlike LLCs and S Corporations with the income “pass through” to 
   members, such that the reserve funds become taxable to members 
   (the so called “phantom income” problem, i.e. owners must pay tax on 
   money held in reserve, even if they do not receive the income in 
   cash), the Collective with Sub-Chapter T taxation will be the only 
   entity that will pay tax on the income kept in reserve, and not the 
   Members themselves. 
   
   5.4.7. Qualifying Patronage Dividends.
   
   The Collective, in order to avoid double taxation of Patronage 
   Dividends, under the Under Sub-Chapter T, shall:  
   
   
     5.4.7.1. Pay out the Patronage Dividends to Members on the basis of 
     their contribution to the Collective expressed and calculated in the 
     amount of “Slices” a Member has earned in relation to all other 
     “Slices” earned by other Members.  
     
     5.4.7.2. Pay out the distributions under a preexisting obligation 
     of the  Collective to pay that amount, and
     
     5.4.7.3. Pay out the distributions calculated based on earnings 
     derived from the Collective’s business done with its Members only 
     (not employees and Non-Members).
     
   As per the IRS ruling in 1971, distributions to Members based on 
   hours worked are patronage dividends and are tax deductible to 
   the Collective.  
   
   5.4.8. Distribution of Surplus to the Members.
   
   At the end of each accounting period (usually the fiscal year, but 
   the Collective may elect quarterly distributions), the  Collective’s 
   accountant or the elected Accounting and Audit Committee shall 
   determine the amount of Surplus earned (money  left over after 
   expenses.) If the Surplus has been earned, the Collective, through 
   the Members vote of 75% or above, must  decide the Patronage 
   Distributions with the following options:
   
     5.4.8.1. Allocate the Surplus to the Reserve Fund to cover unforeseen 
     expenses or invest back into the business, or establish the 
     percentage of the Surplus to be put in the reserves
     
     5.4.8.2. Distribute the Surplus to the Members in the amount of 
     20% per distribution (as required by the IRS Sub-chapter T); or
     
     5.4.8.3. Do some combination of options 1 and 2.
     
   
   The Surplus is distributed not based on ownership interest but on 
   patronage.  The patronage is calculated based on the number of 
   “Slices” earned by a Member relative all “Slices” in the “Pie.”  
   
   The Profits sourced from Non-Members, unlike the Surplus, cannot be 
   distributed to the Members, if the Collective wants to get the tax 
   benefit related to the patronage distributions. 
   
   For each financial period, the Collective shall decide, by the 
   majority vote, if the Patronage Dividend should be paid in cash to 
   Members, or it can allocate all or a portion of the dividend to the 
   Members’ Capital Accounts using a “Written Notice of Allocation” 
   (WNA), which is defined in Sub-chapter T of the IRS.  
   
   The Collective will use WNA to retain cash in the Collective to be 
   used for financing programs that Members decide important and feasible 
   for the business.  The Collective shall establish a Policy that will 
   regulate when the Members can withdraw funds as cash from their 
   Capital Accounts.  The Collective’s intent is to provide for rolling 
   distributions in order to prevent long-time members from accumulating 
   large Capital Accounts.  
   
   The Collective shall not pay no interest on the balance in the Capital 
   Accounts during the initial (bootstrapping) stages of the Collective.  
   The Collective shall review and establish a new Policy for interest 
   accumulation and interest payment to Members from Capital Accounts 
   upon reaching the sustainable phase.
   
   5.4.9. Member Tax Obligations.
   
   Every Member of the Collective agrees to pay all US, State and/or 
   local taxes, as required in his/her jurisdiction.  Every Member 
   understands that even if the Allocations are made to hold the 
   distributions in the Capital Account (via WNA) and no cash is received 
   by the Member, the IRS takes the Allocations into account for tax 
   purposes. 



IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties to this Agreement execute this 
Operating Agreement as of the date and year first above written.
