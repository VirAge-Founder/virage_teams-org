capital of the Collective. Members’ competencies, skills and experience 
define their rate of income that they can earn for themselves and the

proportion to the total volume received from all members.

efficiency in operations the foundational principal to live by and 
measure success in all teams and individuals.  This principle is also 
supported by the Continuous Learner mindset that all members nurture 
and support. 

6. Support of the Cooperative Movement.  As the success of the 
Collective in the Knowledge-based industry solidifies, the Collective 
will support, through its business, cooperatives in other industries.

and apply knowledge generated in the forward thinking organizations, 
for technology solutions and process organization, like The Agile 
Manifesto, SAFe Principles, The 12 Factor App methodology, The Reactive 
Manifesto and the AWS’s Well Architected Framework, to fit the needs of 
a different entity: a decentralized federation of agile teams, 
responsible for creating new value streams and in charge of the fruits
of their labor.
