    Virtual Agile (VitAge) Teams Collective Ltd. Liability Company
                          Vision Statement

Virtual Agile (VirAge) Teams Collective Ltd. Liability Company is a 
cooperative of Owner-Workers who are Digital Knowledge-based Industry 
Professionals of various competencies, skills, occupations and nature 
of talent (artistic, technical, organizational, economic, or leadership).  
We come together to create a new type of a business entity which will 
help us, individually and collectively, achieve our professional goals, 
grow in our particular area of expertise and expand our knowledge in 
other related fields of Digital Product and Services development.   
We have the following vision for our Collective:

1. Individually, we possess skills and competencies that, although 
valuable on the market, will always be pushing us to “sell ourselves” 
on this lowest denominator of the raw potential of what our skills mean. 
Collectively, when organizing into cross-functional teams with many 
competencies, we become an agile force of many capabilities enabling us 
to deliver a complete value, either as a digital product or a service.  
Through the collective teams, we now sell our work, and not ourselves!

2. We believe that the Collective is the foundation for many individuals 
and teams to define their own destiny, career path, line of business 
and revenue streams that the Collective would enable, but it will not 
claim a penny more of the gains than necessary to operate the Collective, 
unlike corporate or private business, where the owners reaping the 
benefits are separated from the creators of value.   In the Collective, 
we are the Owners and we maximize our returns for ourselves.  
As responsible Owners, we also take full responsibility for our 
decisions, minimizing the cost of business and mitigating risks.

3. Despite the economic uncertainties and turbulent chaotic world events, 
we are living the wonderful time of the technological, computing advances 
that provides us with the digital economy of scale.  For the Knowledge 
and Imagination-driven builders and creators of the new meta-verse of 
products, services, relationships and wealth-creating opportunities, 
we don’t need the massive capital investments to kick start operations 
(unlike the classical capitalists of the XIX century).  Our Capital is 
our Knowledge, our ideas are our frontiers to conquer, and our approach 
is Lean-Agile: we start small with a hypothesis, we scale up as we 
prove it, we build wealth and expand through our teams.  Digital 
Universe, with Software as the foundation, and with pillars like Data, 
Content, APIs, Self-Soverign Identity and Digital Energy (aka “money”, 
“crypto-currencies” and “store of value” or “means of exchange”) should 
be the result of our liberated talent, which cannot be governed by the 
dogmas of the XIX century’s Capital-Labor relationships and corporate 
HR-imposed “wage slavery.”

4. The Collective is not a socialist dystopia of universal equality for 
the equality sake.  We are the “Capitalists” in the true sense of equal 
opportunities for contribution-based meritocracy to distribute the 
created wealth.  We all have one vote in our decisions, and we reward 
each other for our patronage to the Collective.  We imagine the 
Collective to grow as big as the largest service companies in the world, 
but built with the true Trust, Commitment, Fairness, Transparency, 
Self-Governance and Self-Reliance on the Owners-Operators teams that do 
the work, local, regional or virtual, across the country.
